The anchovy features broad, thin scales that are readily separated, as well as a forked tail that is deeply forked. Both anchovies have a body that is about 4 to 5 times as long as it is deep.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p></p><h3>Is tilapia considered kosher?</h3><p>This is accomplished by identifying the fish as being of kosher origin.
