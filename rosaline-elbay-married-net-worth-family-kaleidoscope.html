Kaleidoscope is about a master thief who tries to steal $7 billion dollars with his crew but as they began to execute the plan, things do not go accordingly. Rosaline Elbay plays Judy Goodwin, the “explosives expert” or the chemist of the group in the new Netflix heist mystery show.</p><p>Find out about Rosaline’s stint in Netflix’s Kaleidoscope, her net worth, age, personal life, and more in the wiki article below.</p><h3><strong>Rosaline Elbay On Netflix’s Kaleidoscope</strong></h3><p>Netflix’s Kaleidoscope hit the streaming platform on January 1 and it’s already become a hot topic online. While the show does feature a star-studded lineup including Breaking Bad’s Giancarlo Esposito, the credit for its popularity has to be its non-linear approach to storytelling. Viewers can watch Kaleidoscope in any order and each episode title represents different colors.</p><p>The heist mystery chronicles 25 years of time, beginning 24 years prior to the crime. For a whopping 7 billion dollars, a group of highly skilled thieves will attempt to break into the most secure vault in the States.</p><p>Rosaline Elbay plays Judy Goodwin In Kaleidoscope. The official description of her character goes like this: “The crew’s demolitions specialist, Judy is headstrong and independent – an eccentric spitfire with a sarcastic edge who is clever and talented enough to stay a step ahead of her mistakes.”</p><p>Besides Rosaline, the other stars of the show are Giancarlo Exposito as Leo Pap, Paz Vega as Ava Mercer, Jai Courtney as Bob Goodwin, Peter Mark Kendall as Stan Loomis, and Jordan Mendoza as RJ Acosta Jr., to name a few.</p><p>Before Kaleidoscope premiered on Netflix, Rosaline talked about the show a little with Collider’s Steve Weintraub. When asked about how it felt working with The Suicide Squad actor Jai Courtney, she jokingly said, “…I mean he’s a nightmare. It’s been absolutely awful, and I’d love to get that out in print. Thank you so much.”</p><p>In the same interview, Rosaline also shared that it was really fun to work on a heist show like Kaleidoscope. In the show, she shared that it was really challenging to shoot the outdoor scenes for summer in New York winter as for a couple of episodes everything had to be sprayed and drenched in water.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Rosaline Elbay Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Before appearing on Netflix’s Kaleidoscope, Rosaline appeared in a handful of other TV shows and movies, most of which came out over the last few years.</p><p>She is best remembered for playing Amani in Hulu’s comedy series, Ramy, from 2019 to 2020, and Sara in the MBC Masr series, Qabeel. In addition to these TV roles, her other acting credits include the 2019 film Diamond Dust, as well as shorts Fork & Knife and The Isis.</p><p>While Kaleidoscope will certainly be the turning point of Rosaline’s career, her first professional role was in a production of The Sound of Music at the age of 11. Besides The Sound of Music, Rosaline has also appeared in many productions in the Middle East, Europe, and the UK.</p><p>According to afikra.com, Rosaline read Classics at Oxford University. Before joining the drama school, she obtained an undergraduate degree in classical archaeology and a master’s degree in colonial history.</p><p>For acting, Rosaline studied at the Actors Studio New York City with Elizabeth Kemp and received her Master’s in Fine Arts in Acting from the London Academy of Music & Dramatic Art.</p><p>In addition to being an actor, the Kaleidoscope actress is an artist as well. Reportedly, she has been painting almost throughout her life. According to saatchiart.com, Rosaline “draws inspiration from the ancient pictorial representation that she has always been fascinated and surrounded by, veering between expressionism and more rigid forms in various modes of experimentation.”</p><p>As of 2023, her artwork has already been exhibited in Egypt. Currently, she is working out of New York. Rosaline’s artwork reportedly starts from $340 and goes all the way to $1,120.</p><p>As of January 2023, Rosaline Elbay’s net worth was estimated to be under $500 thousand.</p><h3><strong>Is Rosaline Elbay Married?</strong></h3><p>So far, Ramy actress has avoided talking about her dating life in public, which is why we don’t know anything about her relationships. However, it looked like Rosaline was single in 2023. In fact, the States-based artist has never married anyone ever.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Rosaline Elbay?</strong></h3><p>Born in 1990, Rosaline was 32 years old at the time of this writing in Jan 2023.</p><h3><strong>Rosaline Elbay Family</strong></h3><p>Rosaline rarely talks about her personal life on the Internet. That is the reason why we do not know much about her family, including how members are there in her family.</p><p>However, on July 29, 2020, Rosaline did mention her father in a tweet. The tweet read: ‘Latest from family quarantine: Three years later, my father has finally noticed my wrist tattoo.
