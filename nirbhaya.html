She was born into a working-class family, in Ballia, Uttar Pradesh, India.

Jyoti was a Physiotherapy Student and attended ‘Physiotherapy Institute in Dehradun’.</p><p>Jyoti had just graduated from a physiotherapy program. Therefore, her dream was to be a doctor. Moreover, her parents spent their life savings so Nirbhaya could study medicine.</p><p>Likewise, her father’s name is Badrinath Singh and her mother’s name is Asha Devi. Moreover, she had two brothers.</p><p>Moreover, as rape laws in India do not permit using a victim’s name, she was only known as “Nirbhaya”. Therefore, it is one of the many names the Indian media has given her.</p><p>However, Nirbhaya’s mother revealed her real name to the public on Nirbhaya’s 3rd death anniversary in the year 2015.</p><h2><span id=Nirbhaya_8211_Personal_Life>Nirbhaya – Personal Life</span></h2><p>Nirbhaya was dating her then-boyfriend, <strong>Awindra Pratap Pandey.</strong> He was the one who was with her during the incident.</p><p>He was a software engineer at the time.

By that time, she was in critical condition and on a ventilator.</p><p>And, Doctors said there was no medical reason to move her. However, she was airlifted to Mt. Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. Unfortunately, two weeks after the attack, on <strong>December 29, 2012,</strong> she died.</p><p>But, before she died, she made two police statements in the hospital.

And, they were charged with kidnapping, rape, and murder.</p><p>One of the men named Ram Singh committed suicide in prison. There was a teenager at the time, who was given three years in a reformatory.</p><p>And, that was the maximum allowed for a juvenile in India. Other remaining four were given the death penalty.</p><p>On September 10, 2013, the four adult defendants, Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur, and Mukesh Singh (Ram Singh’s brother), were found guilty of rape and murder. Then, three days later, they were sentenced to death by hanging.</p><p>And, her dying wish was for the men to be “burned alive”.
