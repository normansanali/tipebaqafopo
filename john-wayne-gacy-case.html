He performed as a clown in charity events and children’s parties for the hospital.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=john-wayne-gacy-bio>John Wayne Gacy – Bio</h2><p>John Wayne Gacy was born on March 17, 1942, in Chicago, Illinois, to John Stanley Gacy and Marion Elaine Robison.</p><p>He was the second child and only son of his parents.&nbsp; His father worked as an auto repair machinist and was a World War I veteran, while his mother was a stay-at-home mom.&nbsp;</p><p>Gacy’s family was Catholic, and he was of Polish and Danish heritage. His paternal grandparents were Polish immigrants to the United States.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=john-wayne-gacy-the-serial-killer>John Wayne Gacy – The Serial Killer</h2><p>John Wayne Gacy killed around 33 young men and boys in Chicago in the 1970s.</p><p>In 1964, Gacy was found in charge of sodomizing two young boys.</p><p>Gacy, a restaurant manager and the father of two children in Waterloo, Iowa, sees his respect image shattered when two high school boys describe to authorities how he served them alcohol, forced them to watch p*rnographic films, and initiated s*xual contact.&nbsp;</p><p>Gacy was arrested and spent 18 months in prison. By the time he was released, Gacy was divorced, and he decided to move to Chicago with his mother for a fresh start.&nbsp;</p><p>On February 12, 1971, Gacy came into hot waters when he allegedly picked up a teen kid from a bus station and tried to compel him into having s*x, according to Chicago police.&nbsp;</p><p>When the boy fails to appear in court to testify, the charges are withdrawn, and the incident seems to go unnoticed by the Iowa parole board.</p><p>Gacy murdered Timothy Jack McCoy, a 16-year-old, on 3rh January 1972. He persuaded Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago’s Greyhound Bus Terminal into his automobile</p><p>McCoy was taken on a scenic tour of Chicago by Gacy, who then drove him to his home, promising that he may stay the night and be gone back to the station in time for his bus.&nbsp;</p><p>He drove him home later in the night. The two got drunk and indulged in s*xual activities. Gacy murdered him in the morning after they both got into a fight. He was stabbed in his chest and buried in a crawl space.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, he got married to a childhood friend, carol Hoff. he shifted to a new place where he threw parties and built a good reputation in his area. He was loved and respected by the people in the surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He also started his construction <a href=#>business</a> and got into some local politics.&nbsp;</p><p>Gray’s victims were male pr*stitues and teenagers mostly who sued to work for his construction company.&nbsp;</p><p>His modus operandi was to take his victims home and fol them to tie their hands or neck around with a rope. That follows putting them out which chloroform. Then R*pe, them, torture them and kill them.&nbsp;</p><p>One of his most notable methods of binding his victims was to persuade them to let him handcuff them while pretending to be performing a magic trick.&nbsp;</p><p>To stifle their screams, Gacy would place paper towels or fabric (such as a sock or even their underwear) in their mouths, causing them to choke and die.&nbsp;</p><p>He’d also strangle his victims with a rope or a board while s*xually assaulting them with s*x toys, then bury their remains in his crawlspace.&nbsp;</p><p>Gacy would throw lime into the crawlspace on a regular basis to expedite the decomposition of the remains.&nbsp;</p><p>Three victims were dumped into the Des Plaines River to dispose of the property.</p><p>Due to his good character and reputation among the community, his murders went unnoticed.</p><p>After his divorce in 1976, Gacy started R*ping young men and boys and felt personal freedom.</p><p>Later in 1977, a man complained to the police authorities about being assaulted and abducted by John. A follow up report was made but wasn’t investigated.&nbsp;</p><p>In the following year, Gacy murdered a 15-year-old when the stranger went out to ask for a job in the construction company.&nbsp;</p><p>However, in December 1978, after the disappearance of&nbsp; Robert Piest, Gacy came under suspicion when the sources proved that Robert was last seen with John.&nbsp;</p><p>After coming into the radar, the police came to know about Fcay’s sodomizing crime in Iowa, and so the police issued a search warrant for John’s House.&nbsp;</p><p>The investigators started searching; they found several things at John’s house, including a ring, clothes for individuals, a store receipt, and other suspicious items linked him to Piest and other missing cases around the town.</p><p>When the investigation dmoved forward, the investigation team found out that the ing belonged to a missing teenager.</p><p>They also found a person that was an eye evident of Gacy killing people.</p><p>They also noticed the stinking crawled and assumed it was from a damaged sewage pipe.&nbsp;</p><p>However, after Gracy confessed his murders. Investigators found twenty-six corpses butried under the crawl, three buried four other bodies thrown into the rivers under his house.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=john-wayne-gacy-execution>John Wayne Gacy – Execution</h2><p>After all the investigations took place, Gacy was charged guilty and arrested.&nbsp;</p><p>He spent fourteen years in jail for murder. During his sentence, he sued to paint clowns and other figures that generated sales of thousand and thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</p><p>He was also dubbed the Killer clown by the media.</p><p>The 52-year-old was sentenced to death at the Statesville Penitentiary in Joint, Illinois.
