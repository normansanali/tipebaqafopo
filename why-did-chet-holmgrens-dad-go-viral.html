However, it is not just Chet who has caught the public's eye. His father, Dave Holmgren, has also garnered significant attention and even went viral for his unique role in documenting his son's basketball journey. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind Dave Holmgren's viral fame and the impact it has had on both Chet and his family.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Filming his son's games since sixth grade</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Dave Holmgren began filming his son's basketball games when Chet was in sixth grade. This act of dedication and love for his son's passion for the sport laid the foundation for the viral fame that would later follow. Dave's commitment to capturing Chet's games on video demonstrated his unwavering support and belief in his son's talent.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Continuous filming despite Chet's high profile</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Even as Chet's basketball career gained traction and he became a high-profile player, Dave continued to film his son's games. This commitment to his routine, regardless of the attention and spotlight on Chet, showcased Dave's consistency and dedication as a father. It also demonstrated that Chet's success did not alter their relationship or Dave's support.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>No commentary on the videos</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>One unique aspect of Dave's filming style is that he does not provide commentary on the videos. This decision allows viewers, including Chet himself, to experience the games from a different perspective and draw their own conclusions. By refraining from offering his own analysis, Dave lets the game speak for itself and allows viewers to form their own opinions.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Chet occasionally watches the footage</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Chet, despite being the one playing on the court, occasionally takes the time to watch the footage filmed by his father. This provides him with an opportunity to analyze his own performance and gain a different angle on the game. It is a testament to the trust and bond shared between father and son, as Chet values his father's perspective and the insight it provides.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Not allowed to film during March Madness broadcasts</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>While Dave has been a constant presence behind the camera for Chet's games, his filming is not permitted during March Madness broadcasts. The NCAA retains exclusive copyright to all audio and video footage for its championships, including March Madness. This restriction highlights the professional nature of the tournament and the control maintained by the NCAA over its media coverage.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Plans to continue recording Chet's games in the NBA</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Despite the limitations imposed during March Madness, Dave has expressed his intention to continue recording his son's games once Chet reaches the NBA. This commitment to capturing and preserving their shared basketball journey showcases Dave's determination to support his son's career in the long run. It also indicates the importance Dave places on documenting their experiences together as a family.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Appreciation for his dad's dedication</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Chet acknowledges and appreciates his father's dedication to filming his games. He recognizes the efforts his dad has made to ensure that his grandmother, who is unable to attend in-person games, can still watch and be a part of his basketball journey. Dave's videography has allowed Chet's grandmother to stay connected and witness his growth as a player, highlighting the family's bond and the role his father plays in supporting his dreams.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Dave Holmgren's decision to film his son Chet's basketball games since sixth grade has not only showcased his unwavering support but has also made him a viral sensation. His commitment to capturing these moments on video, despite Chet's high profile and the attention he receives, has resonated with fans and viewers alike. Dave's unique approach of filming without commentary and his determination to continue recording Chet's games in the future demonstrate his love for his son and the importance he places on their shared basketball journey. As Chet continues to excel in his basketball career, it is clear that his father's presence and dedication will remain an integral part of his success.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn7JllJ6xbq%2FHnqtmoJ%2Bhuqi%2BxKeqZpyRmXqou4yvoKuZnA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-chet-holmgrens-dad-go-viral.html&text=Why%20Did%20Chet%20Holmgren%27s%20dad%20go%20viral%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-chet-holmgrens-dad-go-viral.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-chet-holmgrens-dad-go-viral.html&title=Why%20Did%20Chet%20Holmgren%27s%20dad%20go%20viral%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-did-chet-holmgrens-dad-go-viral.html&title=Why%20Did%20Chet%20Holmgren%27s%20dad%20go%20viral%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-chet-holmgrens-dad-go-viral.html&title=Why%20Did%20Chet%20Holmgren%27s%20dad%20go%20viral%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-chet-holmgrens-dad-go-viral.html&description=Why%20Did%20Chet%20Holmgren%27s%20dad%20go%20viral%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alyson-hannigans-husband-all-about-alexis-denisof-5170201.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All About Alexis Denisof  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-brother-polight-girlfriend-is-he-really-arrested-for-rape-charges-of-his-girlfriends-daughter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Brother Polight Girlfriend?
