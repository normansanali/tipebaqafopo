James Cameron’s “Avatar: The Way of Water” is now playing in theaters, and with it comes a question moviegoers will probably be asking themselves once the credits roll: What does the cast actually look like?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In the original “Avatar,” actors such as Sam Worthington, Stephen Lang, Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Rodriguez and Joel David Moore all appeared on screen in their own bodies for significant amounts of screen time. That’s not the case with “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which, for most of its three-hour runtime, includes no human actors on-screen.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">That’s not to say “Avatar: The Way of Water” is without its humans. Joel David Moore and Dileep Rao are back in brief roles as two scientists on Pandora who have allied themselves with the Na’vi. Brendan Cowell and Jemaine Clement are newcomers to the franchise, playing two central figures on a marine hunting vessel on Pandora. Also new are Edie Falco, playing the evil new army commander on Pandora, and Jack Champion as Spider, a teenager born on Pandora who has deep ties to Jake Sully’s Na’vi family.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The rest of the “Avatar: The Way of Water” main cast all appear as Na’vi courtesy of motion capture. See all of the faces behind the Na’vi characters in the cast breakdown below.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Sam Worthington as Jake Sully</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sam-worthington.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sam Worthington returns to the “Avatar” franchise as Jake Sully, who now lives permanently as a Na’vi after his consciousness was transplanted from his human body to his Na’vi avatar at the end of the original film. Jake is the leader of the Pandora forest tribe, known as the Omaticaya people.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We started work on it in, I think, 2015 was when I first saw things of it and 2017 was when we first started. It’s been a gradual continued process, like a big journey,” Sam Worthington <a href=#>told Variety</a> of making the “Avatar” sequel. “It’s a labor of love rather than making a movie. That’s what it feels like.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Worthington added about the film’s extensive underwater scenes, “We were doing something that had never been done before. But James Cameron and I get along because I’m fearless. If he asks me to, I’m going to dive in. I’m good at putting aside all the mechanics and just focusing on ‘What does the boss need me to do?’”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Zoe Saldaña as Neytiri</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/zoe-saldana.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Zoe Saldaña reprises her role of Neytiri, Jake Sully’s wife and one of the best warriors among the Omaticaya people. The actor managed to hold her breath underwater for five minutes while filming diving scenes. Saldaña <a href=#>told Variety</a> that getting the chance to work with James Cameron is a once-in-a-lifetime collaboration.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I got to work with my idol at a very early stage of my career,” she said. “If it wasn’t for Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley, these iconic characters of the ’80s, where would I be? There are so many themes that will resonate with people, starting with the power of family… Family is not just the one that you’re born into, but it’s also the one that you choose or chooses you.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/stephen-lang.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Stephen Lang is back in villain mode as Colonel Miles Quaritch, who died at the end of the first “Avatar” film. How is Quaritch back? It’s a relatively straightforward reveal in “The Way Water,” but still one that’s best to discover in theaters. This time, however, Lang appears as a Na’vi avatar and not a human character. “Doing the water work was challenging and difficult,” he <a href=#>told Variety</a>. “But we were really led by a terrific team of professionals who were with us every step of the way, making sure that we were as safe as one can possibly be when one is doing a knife fight 25 feet below the surface. I enjoyed pretty much every moment of it, even when it’s painful and even when it’s frustrating, even when I just felt things were really going to hell, you know, still, I can’t think of any place I would rather be than there.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Sigourney Weaver as Kiri</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sigourney-weaver.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sigourney Weaver starred as scientist Grace Augustine in “Avatar,” but she returns in “The Way of Water” as a different character: Kiri, Jake and Neytiri’s adopted teenage daughter. Weaver told <a href=#>Empire magazine</a> that it wasn’t too difficult to step into the shoes of a teenage girl. “I think we all pretty much remember what we were feeling as adolescents,” Weaver said. “I certainly do. I was 5’ 10” or 5’ 11” when I was 11. I felt strongly that Kiri would feel awkward a lot of the time. She’s searching for who she is. I was thrilled to be given that challenge by Jim.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“As an acting challenge, it’s big,” added James Cameron, who also directed Weaver in “Aliens.” “We’re gonna have a 60-something actor playing a character [decades younger than] her actual biological age. Sig thought it was all kinds of fun… She just became younger. She looked younger, she had more energy, and she never quite stepped out of Kiri for our whole capture period. She had a glow on her face and lightness in her step and a fun spirit.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Kate Winslet as Ronal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kate-winslet.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Kate Winslet joins the “Avatar” franchise as Ronal, a free diver of the water tribe (known in the film as the Metkayina) and the wife of the tribe’s leader Tonowari (Cliff Curtis, see below). Ronal is pregnant, but she still rides into battle to protect her homeland. “She is strong. A warrior,” Winslet told <a href=#>Empire magazine</a> about her character. “Even in the face of grave danger, and with an unborn baby on board, she still joins her people and fights for what she holds most dear: her family and their home.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Winslet set a record while filming the movie, holding her breath for seven minutes and 15 seconds. “I have the video of me surfacing saying, ‘Am I dead, have I died?’ And then going, ‘What was [my time]?’” Winslet said ahead of the movie’s opening. “Straight away I wanted to know my time. And I couldn’t believe it… The next thing I say is, ‘We need to radio set. I wanted Jim to know right away.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Speaking to Variety ahead of “The Way of Water” release, Winslet said filming in massive water tanks was “completely amazing.” She added, “I absolutely loved it. When you’re working with real experts who know how to keep you safe and know how to teach you to maximize your fullest potential in a situation like that one, and will look after you, it was an amazing experience. It’s not something you can just try at home by yourself.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Cliff Curtis as Tonowari</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cliff-curtis.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Cliff Curtis plays Tonowari, the leader of the Metkayina tribe. Think of Tonowari as the Jake Sully of his free-diving tribe. As the leader of Pandora’s water dwellers, Curtis had to train extra hard in free diving in order to look like a natural. “It’s a peak experience for me,” he <a href=# rel=nofollow>told press </a>during the film’s junket. “I just loved all of that. I loved being in the water. I found it like a real home for me that I was very, very comfortable with.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Jamie Flatters as Neteyam</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jamie-flatters.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Jamie Flatters stars as Neteyam, the oldest son of Jake and Neytiri. “He wants to be a warrior like his father, but also he knows what the dangers are,” Flatters told Variety. “To get to see yourself in the film… all actors want to experience an emotion outside of themselves and something larger than the limits of who they are in the moment. To be a blue alien creature… it’s pretty cool.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Because I was playing the eldest son, I wanted to hit a long breath hold. But I just blacked out,” Flatters added. “That didn’t work out. I sort of lost motor control and saw God, but it felt really good afterwards.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Britain Dalton as Lo’ak</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/britain-dalton.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Britain Dalton stars as Lo’ak, Jake and Neytiri’s second son who is a bit of a hot head when it comes to listening to his parents’ orders. Lo’ak is always getting into the most trouble because he can’t exactly follow his father’s rules. “He’s a rebel, sort of a guy who gets in trouble and a screw-up in that way,” Dalton <a href=# rel=nofollow>told press</a>. “He’s an outcast and he’s alone in the world.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Trinity Jo-Li Bliss as Tuk</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/trinity-jo-li-bliss.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Trinity Jo-Li Bliss plays Tuk, Jake and Neytiri’s adorable daughter and the youngest member of the Sully family. “She does not see herself as the youngest,” the actor told Variety. “The family might be protective of her, but she sees that as underestimation. She doesn’t underestimate herself. She’s got a really big heart and is so curious. She’ll do anything to protect her family and Pandora. Seeing Tuk on the screen in her final form was incredible… I just have so much love in my heart whenever I look at my little Tuk.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Bailey Bass as Tsireya</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bailey-bass.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bailey Bass stars as Tsireya, a free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari and Ronal’s daughter. Tsireya becomes a love interest for Lo’ak. “She’s strong, kind and I think people will see the beauty inside as well as the beauty outside,” Bass told Variety. “The first time I saw myself… she’s beautiful! You’ve never seen the Metkayina clan. It’s new and fresh and exciting. To be a part of that is phenomenal. What’s going to stick with me is the honor of being part of a franchise that’s more than just moviemaking, it’s going to connect people together. These action scenes have so much heart in them and so much emotion. Being a part of that is really exciting.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Filip Geljo as Aonung</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/filip-geljo.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Filip Geljo plays Aonung, a young male hunter and free diver of the Metkayina who happens to be Tonowari and Ronal’s son. While he’s protective of his sister, Tsireya, he’s not exactly ready to welcome the Sully family with open arms.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Duane Evans Jr. as Rotxo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/duane-evans-jr.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Duane Evans Jr. stars as Roxto, a young male hunter and free-diver of the Metkayina who is best friends with Aonung.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>CCH Pounder as Mo’at</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cch-pounder.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">CCH Pounder returns very briefly as Mo’at, the Omaticaya’s spiritual leader and Neytiri’s mother. Because the plot of the film finds the Sully family leaving their home and taking refuge with the water tribe, Pounder’s screen time is far more limited than her supporting turn in the original “Avatar.”</p></li></ul><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap lrv-a-font-primary-s o-nav__title a-content-ignore lrv-u-margin-r-050">Read More About:</h4><ul
