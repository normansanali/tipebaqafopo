The Pitch Perfect actress dropped nearly 80 pounds and achieved her desired weight. But, more importantly, she appears to be content with her new lifestyle.</p><p>A quick look through her Instagram reveals that she’s been filming Senior Year for Netflix, hosting the BAFTAs, traveling extensively, and flaunting her body “on Instagram shamelessly,” as she told People.</p><p>The 42-year-old star has been upfront about her weight-loss journey, but how did she accomplish it? Here’s everything you need to know:</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="Who Is The Prince On The Masked Singer?

Everything Know About Price Frog</a></p><h2><strong>Rebel Wilson’s Weight Loss Journey</strong></h2><p>Rebel declared 2020 to be her “year of health,” promising followers that she will focus on fitness and work toward her desired weight of 165 pounds. She’s been relying on a mixture of exercise and a nutritious diet to achieve this.</p><p>Rebel originally shared her plans in January 2020 on her Instagram account. She began by simply increasing her walking and making some sensible eating choices. “I put on my athleisure and went for a stroll,” she added. “Right now, I’m purposely hydrating on the sofa and trying to avoid sweets and junk food, which is going to be difficult after the holidays I’ve just had, but I’m going to do it!”</p><p>“Thanks for all the love so far on my ‘Year of Health’ journey—when I was going for the candies last night after dinner I thought to myself ‘hmmm…better not’ and had a bottle of water instead,” she said in an update at the end of August.</p><p>Rebel revealed on Instagram that she was three kilos (approximately six pounds) away from her goal weight, alongside a snapshot of herself showing off her progress and a beautiful view during a hike. (By the way, her trainer is a huge believer in taking progress photos, but more on that later.)</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Rebel Wilson (@rebelwilson)</a></p><h2><strong>Rebel Wilson Prior To Her Weight Loss</strong></h2><p>Rebel was booked and occupied with a number of tasks prior to her healthy weight loss journey. The actress catapulted to prominence in 2011 after starring in the Oscar-nominated comedy Bridesmaids. Rebel had a modest, supporting role in the picture, but she left a huge effect on the audience. Rebel’s reputation had risen to new heights by 2012 when she was cast as Fat Amy in the film Pitch Perfect. She would return in the sequel and third installments of the film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Rebel-Wilson-Prior-To-Her-Weight-Loss.webp><p>Rebel went on to land huge parts that showcased her comedic abilities. She’s most recognized for her roles in films including How To Be Single, The Hustle, and Isn’t It Romantic. Rebel’s focus shifted from physical humor to a more serious approach to her heath and profession as her reputation developed. Rebel began documenting her workouts, trips to Australia and Los Angeles, weight loss objectives, and so much more in 2020, as she opened up and gave her fans a completely new, honest side of herself. Rebel needed to take a step back and focus on her physical and mental transformation.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="The Northman (2022) Ending Explained In Detail: Does Amleth Achieve His Quest of Vengeance?" href=# rel=bookmark>The Northman (2022) Ending Explained In Detail: Does Amleth Achieve His Quest of Vengeance?</a></p><h2><strong>So, how does Rebel exercise?</strong></h2><p>Rebel has been training out seven days a week with trainer Jono Castano. (She is serious about working hard.) The actress revealed a new challenging technique in her routine: tire flipping.</p><p>Rebel said the following on a video of her flipping fitness session: “Starting the week off right! Look out @chrishemsworth & @liamhemsworth Australia’s latest action hero is turning it up.”</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Rebel Wilson (@rebelwilson)</a></p><p>Stair sprints and battle rope battles are also part of her workout.

Rebel revealed to People that she used to consume 3,000 calories each day.</p><p>“Before I was probably eating 3,000 calories most days, and because they were normally carbs, I would still be hungry,” she said. “So, I’ve really changed to eating a high-protein diet, which is challenging because I didn’t use to eat a lot of meat. I eat fish, salmon, and chicken breast.”</p><p>However, she credits the coronavirus epidemic with causing her to slow down and change her “poor habits” for the better. It allowed her to concentrate more on her general health and her emotional eating issues.</p><p>“I definitely think with the slow down, it did help,” she says. “I think I was emotional eating, and overeating at times because I wasn’t loving myself enough either. And it does come down to that self-worth and self-love.”</p><p>Rebel, on the other hand, isn’t deprived.</p><p>“I’m just trying to go for overall balance, overall healthy balance,” she said. “I have this state of being, which is not my quote, but I go ‘Nothing is forbidden.’ We’ll be like, ‘Should we get In-N-Out burger?’ And I’m like, ‘Nothing is forbidden.’ I can go there, I just might eat half of what I used to eat before. Do you know? And I’ll have a burger, and a few fries, and then you feel fine.”</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Rebel Wilson (@rebelwilson)</a></p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="Resident Evil: Netflix Release Date Confirmed And Coming In July 2022" href=# rel=bookmark>Resident Evil: Netflix Release Date Confirmed And Coming In July 2022</a></p><h2><strong>Rebel Opens With Fans About Her Weight Loss Goals</strong></h2><p>In a now-deleted Instagram post from July, she disclosed her exact weight reduction goals: “I’ll be honest with you guys—with my ‘Year of Health’ mission I’m trying to get to 75kg’s and career-wise am trying to get one of my movies into production before the end of the year! Both of these things are requiring a daily effort and there are constant setbacks—but I’m working hard x.” (FYI: 75 kg is roughly 165 lbs.)</p><h2><strong>Rebel Before And After photo</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Rebel-Before-After.jpeg><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="Virgin River Season 4 Release Date Set For Summer 2022: Netflix Renew The Show: Everything We Know So Far!" href=# rel=bookmark>Virgin River Season 4 Release Date Set For Summer 2022: Netflix Renew The Show: Everything We Know So Far!</a></p><h2 class=first-sentence-half><strong>Rebel&nbsp;Wilson’s&nbsp;Weight&nbsp;Loss&nbsp;Transformation</strong></h2><p>When Rebel started losing weight, she noticed a significant difference in how people treated her. “I think what’s been really interesting is how other people treat you,” On the Australian radio program The Morning Team with Hughesy, Ed, and Erin on January 27, the actress said. “Sometimes being bigger, people didn’t necessarily look twice at you,” Rebel continued. “Now that I’m in good shape, people offer to carry my groceries to the car and hold doors open for you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvRnpmepF2stq2%2Fzqdkm52WpL%2BmecCnm2aZlqmys3nWnqCgoKRiubC%2F0mhtcm5lZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frebel-wilson-before-and-after-weight-loss.html&text=Rebel%20Wilson%20Before%20And%20After%20Weight%20Loss%20Transformation%20For%20senior%20Year%20Photos%20Going%20Viral%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frebel-wilson-before-and-after-weight-loss.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frebel-wilson-before-and-after-weight-loss.html&title=Rebel%20Wilson%20Before%20And%20After%20Weight%20Loss%20Transformation%20For%20senior%20Year%20Photos%20Going%20Viral%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frebel-wilson-before-and-after-weight-loss.html&title=Rebel%20Wilson%20Before%20And%20After%20Weight%20Loss%20Transformation%20For%20senior%20Year%20Photos%20Going%20Viral%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frebel-wilson-before-and-after-weight-loss.html&title=Rebel%20Wilson%20Before%20And%20After%20Weight%20Loss%20Transformation%20For%20senior%20Year%20Photos%20Going%20Viral%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frebel-wilson-before-and-after-weight-loss.html&description=Rebel%20Wilson%20Before%20And%20After%20Weight%20Loss%20Transformation%20For%20senior%20Year%20Photos%20Going%20Viral%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bella-hadid-holiday-photo-dump-string-bikinis.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="See Bella Hadid Celebrate the Holidays In String Bikinis and Stylish Looks">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nikki-goeser-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-314828-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nikki Goeser Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
