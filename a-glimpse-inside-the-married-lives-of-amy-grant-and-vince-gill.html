This month, Grant was involved in a bicycle accident that required her to reschedule her outings.</strong></p><p>Vince is now on tour with the Eagles, and his daughter Corinna Gill joined him at the Ryman Auditorium on Thursday, August 4. When My Amy Prays from his 2019 album Okie was performed as a duet by Corinna and her father.</p><p>Corrina compared herself to her father throughout her performance and sang “when my mother prays” instead of “when my Amy prays”</p><h2>Vince Gill and Amy Grant’s connection</h2><p>In 2000, Vince Gill and Amy Grant wed. They first met in 1993 as they prepared to make a music video for the title track of Grant’s 1994 album, House of Love.</p><p>Grant described their initial meeting as “immediately familiar,” and she was so moved by his humanity that she embraced him as he was performing. Gill was motivated by Grant to compose the song Whenever You Come Around, which he played in 2015 at the Ryman.</p><p>Amy Grant wrote in 1993,</p><p><strong>“I was inspired to write this song by a smile I saw on the face of a woman I had never met.” I was so moved by that smile that I went home and composed this song. I had no idea that we would end up together and having children after all these years… “Life is funny.”</strong></p><p>They developed feelings for one another while being married at the time. Following the dissolution of their previous unions, they wed in 2000. The children of Grant were reportedly preparing to join a new family. Corrina, the daughter of Grant and Gill, was born in March 2001.</p><h2>Personal details on Vince Gill and Amy Grant</h2><p>In 1980, Vince Gill wed Janis Oliver for the first time. The couple met in Los Angeles in 1982 and had a daughter named Jenny. 1997 saw their divorce. On the other side, Amy Grant was married to Gary Chapman.</p><p>They wed in June 1982 and currently have three children. In 1999, due to irreconcilable differences, Grant and Chapman divorced. Grant answered when questioned why she divorced Vince that it was not because she had affection for him.</p><p>She stated:</p><p><strong>“From the start, Gary and I had a difficult walk. One of our counselors mentioned that what made the situation so difficult was the fact that periodically an innocent person will enter a scene and operate as a large spotlight. They serve to accentuate the already-existing negative dynamics.”</strong></p><p>Vince Gill rose to notoriety as the lead singer of Pure Prairie League in the 1970s. He had a phenomenal solo career, releasing 20 studio albums and 40 singles, and he has been honored with numerous accolades, including two Grammys.</p><p>Amy Grant is best recognized as the “Queen of Christian Pop” due to the fact that she has sold over 30 million CDs. Six Grammy Awards and twenty-two Dove Awards from the Gospel Music Association are held by the vocalist.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Scott Thompson Top On Body Enhancements And Plastic Surgery Disasters"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":37248,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/scott-thompson-top-on-body-enhancements-and-plastic-surgery-disasters/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/scott-thompson-top-on-body-enhancements-and-plastic-surgery-disasters/"}{"1":80}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Scott Thompson Top On Body Enhancements And Plastic Surgery Disasters</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Musician</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Singer-Songwriter</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Frank Ocean Withdraws From Coachella’s Second Weekend Headlining Performance</a></h3>Frank Ocean will not perform his second headlining set at Coachella this weekend due to criticism of his first performance last weekend.
