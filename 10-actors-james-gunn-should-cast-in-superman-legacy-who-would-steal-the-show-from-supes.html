Whoever has to slip into the bright red boots previously worn by Henry Cavill has a tough job on their hands, but writer (and probably director) <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">James Gunn</a></strong> is likely to go in a completely different direction, as intel suggests <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest Last Son of Krypton will be around 25</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>However, a Superman movie is much more than just the hero with his name in the title. Sure, Christopher Reeve might be the star of the 1978 classic, but the contributions of Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando, and others helped make it the iconic piece of cinema it is today. In that vein, here are 10 actors Gunn needs to cast in Superman: Legacy who might even manage to steal the show away from the mysterious Man of Steel himself.</p><h2 id=h-kate-mckinnon-as-maggie-sawyer data-injectable=false>Kate McKinnon as Maggie Sawyer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Maggie_Sawyer.jpg><p data-characters=528 data-current-count=828 data-injectable=true>Maggie Sawyer isn’t one of the most recognizable supporting characters from the Superman mythos, but that’s why Gunn needs to fix that in Legacy. The Metropolis PD detective — one of the few openly lesbian characters in comics when first introduced in the late 1980s — could be depicted as Clark Kent’s own answer to Batman’s Commissioner Gordon. To add some charisma to the role, we’d need Gunn to hire someone who makes the most of any part they play — like the one and only Kate McKinnon.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Sadie Sink as Lana Lang</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sadie-sink-stranger-things-max-e1673304294666.jpg><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=837 data-injectable=true>Outside of the couple’s angst-ridden adolescent romance on Smallville, Lana Lang’s status as Clark’s first love is something that most Superman adaptations tend to skip over. Legacy could bolster her role, however, by either revealing Clark’s relationship with Lana during his teen years via flashbacks or else see her return to his life in the present, throwing a spanner in the works of his blossoming connection with Lois. In either case, Stranger Things‘ Sadie Sink would be a brilliant casting choice.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Sheryl Lee Ralph as Martha Kent</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sheryl-lee-ralph-abbot-elementary.jpg><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=771 data-injectable=true>Martha Kent is one of the most underrated characters in any Superman story as Clark’s adoptive human mother arguably serves as the moral compass of her alien son, pointing him in the right direction, much like Spider-Man’s Aunt May. We’re used to seeing her play a more caustic character in TV’s Abbot Elementary, but Sheryl Lee Ralph could be a tremendous pick to be the latest actress to portray Jonathan Kent’s widow in Superman: Legacy.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Noah Jupe as Jimmy Olsen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jimmy_olsen.jpg><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=792 data-injectable=true>Poor Jimmy Olsen, apparently so detested by Zack Snyder that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he was killed off in his one and only scene</a> in Batman v Superman. Gunn has the opportunity to go back to basics with The Daily Planet’s intern photographer, then, offering up a keen but wet-behind-the-ears ally for Clark and Lois. Considering that those two will only be in their mid-20s in this flick, Jimmy would have to be even younger, though, making Wonder‘s Noah Jupe (currently 17) the perfect age for the part.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Nathan Fillion as Perry White</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/perry-white-dc-comic.jpg><p data-characters=498 data-current-count=798 data-injectable=true>Given James Gunn and Nathan Fillion’s close working relationship, we fully expected the latter’s Suicide Squad character T.D.K. to return for Peacemaker, but that never happened. While he could still pop up in Waller, it might be more fun to cast him in a fresh role in the new DCU. So how about Perry White, The Daily Planet Editor-In-Chief? To be honest, Perry often comes across as a Diet version of J. Jonah Jameson, but Fillion could bring a great comedic energy to the character.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Dave Bautista as Bibbo Bibbowski</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bibbo-bibbowski.jpg><p data-characters=534 data-current-count=834 data-injectable=true>Dave Bautista <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">definitely won’t be the DCU’s Bane</a>, but Gunn’s promise that all of the Guardians of the Galaxy will be invited aboard his shiny, new franchise eventually tells us he’ll show up somewhere. And this might be the best role for him. Every other Superman movie has shied away from the long-standing comics character of Bibbo Bibbowski, a tough-guy barman and bruiser who’s nonetheless the Man of Steel’s biggest fan, but Gunn is exactly the sort to finally give him a shot in live-action.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/smallville_f79d53c4-e1677254208117.jpg><p data-characters=558 data-current-count=858 data-injectable=true>Now wouldn’t this just blow everyone’s minds? Michael Rosenbaum is another of Gunn’s closest collaborators, so it’s a given <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he’ll show up in the DCU somewhere</a>. But it would be really something if he was brought back as Lex Luthor, following his still definitive portrayal of the villain on Smallville. His Lex wouldn’t have to be — and probably shouldn’t be – the main villain, but this multiversal crossover would be the coolest of its kind since (fellow) Michael Keaton’s Batman return in The Flash.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jude Law as Brainiac</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jude-law-captain-marvel-e1677254396816.jpg><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=807 data-injectable=true>When it comes to who should be the central antagonist of Legacy, though, there’s one extremely obvious contender: Brainiac, the most notable Superman villain yet to have a movie appearance to his name. As for who should finally bring the knowledge-hoarding android to life, Jude Law would be a smart choice. Not only would he nail the robot’s cool and sinister demeanor, he has a secret history with Superman himself, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he came close to landing the part of the Man of Steel</a> in the early 2000s.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Henry Cavill as Jor-El</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/henry-cavill-man-of-steel-1.jpg><p data-characters=503 data-current-count=803 data-injectable=true>In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the words of James Gunn himself</a>, Henry Cavill was severely “d*cked” around by DC, which is a true crime given how much Cavill loves Superman. So maybe Gunn can extend an olive branch to both the star and his loyal fans by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">offering Cavill a small but key role in Legacy</a>, that of Kal-El’s biological father, Jor-El? Having Cavill take on the part that Russell Crowe played opposite him a decade ago could be a moving way to close the door on his DC career by bringing it full circle.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Camila Mendes as Lois Lane</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/lois-lane-camila-mendes.jpg><p data-characters=551 data-current-count=851 data-injectable=true>Naturally, though, the most important supporting role outside of Superman in a Superman movie is that of Lois Lane, the First Lady of the DC Universe herself. There are various directions Gunn could go with the character, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a surprisingly convincing Reddit thread</a> has argued that Riverdale‘s Camila Mendes would be a spot-on pick for The Daily Planet’s greatest reporter, and honestly it’s hard to disagree. She has the perfect energy, is the perfect age, and she’s already got <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">married to TV Supes Tyler Hoechlin in a movie</a>.</p><p data-characters=59 data-current-count=59 data-injectable=false>Superman: Legacy is scheduled to release on July 11, 2025.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoaGllkZjBsL7SZqGapZWoeqjBzadkrKCfqrmlecKaqq1lmaN6tMHPnqmmmZ5iuaazwJywZq%2BYpHq4u9Slm2arpJqurXnToZxmq5ikxG6y0aikZqulpbK0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-actors-james-gunn-should-cast-in-superman-legacy-who-would-steal-the-show-from-supes.html&text=10%20actors%20James%20Gunn%20should%20cast%20in%20Superman%3a%20Legacy%20who%20would%20steal%20the%20show%20from%20Supes&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-actors-james-gunn-should-cast-in-superman-legacy-who-would-steal-the-show-from-supes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-actors-james-gunn-should-cast-in-superman-legacy-who-would-steal-the-show-from-supes.html&title=10%20actors%20James%20Gunn%20should%20cast%20in%20Superman%3a%20Legacy%20who%20would%20steal%20the%20show%20from%20Supes" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-actors-james-gunn-should-cast-in-superman-legacy-who-would-steal-the-show-from-supes.html&title=10%20actors%20James%20Gunn%20should%20cast%20in%20Superman%3a%20Legacy%20who%20would%20steal%20the%20show%20from%20Supes" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-actors-james-gunn-should-cast-in-superman-legacy-who-would-steal-the-show-from-supes.html&title=10%20actors%20James%20Gunn%20should%20cast%20in%20Superman%3a%20Legacy%20who%20would%20steal%20the%20show%20from%20Supes" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-actors-james-gunn-should-cast-in-superman-legacy-who-would-steal-the-show-from-supes.html&description=10%20actors%20James%20Gunn%20should%20cast%20in%20Superman%3a%20Legacy%20who%20would%20steal%20the%20show%20from%20Supes" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alexa-dellanos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alexa Dellanos">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-did-gi-hun-dye-his-hair-red-in-squid-game-all-you-need-to-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why did Gi Hun dye his hair red in Squid Game?
