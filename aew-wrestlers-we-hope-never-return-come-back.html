However, during his time at AEW, he failed to prove an overall charisma that would make him a strong TV character.</p><p>It was for the best that Evans left AEW, as fans had little interest when he was on-screen. Most fans won’t have an overwhelming desire to see him back, and he would likely be greeted with a dull reaction if he were to return.

He didn't do too much during his time in AEW, so wasn’t missed at all when he left.</p><h2 id=andrade-el-idolo><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Andrade El Idolo</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/andrade-el-idolo-cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Andrade El Idolo is currently suspended in AEW following a fight with Sammy Guevera</a>. Andrade initiated this to try and force a firing, but was instead suspended.</p><p>This sort of behavior is something that AEW does not need any more of, and it would be best to let his contract run out and leave him away from programming. In AEW, Andrade’s booking wasn’t great anyway, so he hasn’t been missed as such, even with his incredible talents.</p><h2 id=jake-atlas><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jake Atlas</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jake-Atlas-in-AEW-Cropped.jpg><p>After a promising start in AEW, Jake Atlas suffered a long-term injury.
