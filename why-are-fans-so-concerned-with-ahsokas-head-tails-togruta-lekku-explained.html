It’s easy to understand why, then, fans were so disgruntled to see a very specific physical feature misrepresented in Rosario Dawson’s live-action portrayal of the character in The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=377 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>For the most part, Dawson has been praised for capturing Ahsoka’s determination and stubbornness to a tee. Disney, too, has been lauded for the execution of the character’s storyline in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action Ahsoka series</a>. However, the conversation surrounding her head tails has followed the character into every project she’s appeared in, including her solo show.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>Indeed, fans have remained fixated on the length of Ahsoka’s head tails, otherwise known as lekku, since that very first cameo in The Mandalorian. The complaints aren’t without merit, but there’s also a very reasonable counterargument. Here’s what you should know about the situation.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-conversation-around-ahsoka-s-head-tails-explained data-injectable=false>The conversation around Ahsoka’s head tails, explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Ashsoka-Star-Wars-Rebels.jpg><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>In the Star Wars universe, lekku are fleshy appendages that protrude <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">out of the heads</a> of the Torgruta species, to which Ahsoka belongs. Twi’leks and male Ozrelanso have lekku as well, but the Togruta species is the only one to have three head tails and two head horns, known as montrals.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>In Star Wars lore, a Torgruta’s lekku grows as they age, serving as a mark of maturity. By the time Ahsoka Tano is introduced in The Mandalorian, she’s already been through hell and high water in The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels. For this reason, fans were upset to see Ahsoka’s lekku were noticeably short in her live-action appearances.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>It didn’t make sense for the character to have such short lekku when the animated version of her in Rebels, which takes place around the same time as The Mandalorian, had much longer lekku.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why Ahsoka’s head tails look so different</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ahsoka-Tano.jpg><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>It turns out, the noticeably shorter length was for practical reasons, at least according to Lucasfilm’s character concept designer Brian Matyas. In a tweet responding to a fan, Matyas confirmed that Dawson’s Ahsoka had much shorter lekku in The Mandalorian to accommodate for stunts.</p><p>“Yea pretty much that was the chief concern. From animation to live action I did a ton of design exploration for her and their appropriate size for the actor with consideration for stunts and movement. I’m sure I’ll get to discuss at greater length in the near future!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yea pretty much that was the chief concern.

The head tails that once fell just barely below her shoulder in The Book of Boba Fett now dangled well past her sternum.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>So glad she's gonna have the longer head tails in Ahsoka!

This time around they were 3-D printed and “screwed into my head with this cap… I think the level of detail on this is unlike anything.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rosario explains how the head tails were updated for AHSOKA <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/680dBezh1e</a></p>— Live-Action Ahsoka Fan Account (ia) (@LAahsokathinker) <a href=#>June 23, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>Still, the slight increase in length hasn’t been enough for some fans to forget what Ahsoka’s lekku should look like at this point in her life. On paper, they should be longer than they were in Star Wars Rebels, which they aren’t. For those anal-retentive fans, it’s been too big of an eyesore to overlook.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Am I the only one unsatisfied with head-tails of Ahsoka in the Disney series?

Perhaps the intent is to ensure there are many more years for the character to keep up the progression in future projects. Or perhaps it truly does come down to practicality, maneuvering through action sequences, and so on.</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>If there’s one thing to know about Star Wars fans it’s that the hyper-fixation on minute details like this is merely a sign of respect and adoration for the IP. So, while it may seem tedious, it comes from a good place. Thankfully, it appears as though Disney is listening to the discourse and making the necessary adjustments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tNhmmKudXZuur7%2BMrKZmm5%2BjsKa%2BzZ6bZq%2BZqbVurcespqSZo2K1pq3DZquaoZyoerW7xqusrZldobKst9RmnLGonJa2r7HDaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-are-fans-so-concerned-with-ahsokas-head-tails-togruta-lekku-explained.html&text=Why%20are%20fans%20so%20concerned%20with%20Ahsokas%20head%20tails%3f%20Togruta%20Lekku%2c%20explained&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-are-fans-so-concerned-with-ahsokas-head-tails-togruta-lekku-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-are-fans-so-concerned-with-ahsokas-head-tails-togruta-lekku-explained.html&title=Why%20are%20fans%20so%20concerned%20with%20Ahsokas%20head%20tails%3f%20Togruta%20Lekku%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-are-fans-so-concerned-with-ahsokas-head-tails-togruta-lekku-explained.html&title=Why%20are%20fans%20so%20concerned%20with%20Ahsokas%20head%20tails%3f%20Togruta%20Lekku%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-are-fans-so-concerned-with-ahsokas-head-tails-togruta-lekku-explained.html&title=Why%20are%20fans%20so%20concerned%20with%20Ahsokas%20head%20tails%3f%20Togruta%20Lekku%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-are-fans-so-concerned-with-ahsokas-head-tails-togruta-lekku-explained.html&description=Why%20are%20fans%20so%20concerned%20with%20Ahsokas%20head%20tails%3f%20Togruta%20Lekku%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./xavier-roberts-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Xavier Roberts Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-teams-are-in-mlb-playoffs-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What teams are in MLB playoffs 2023?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
