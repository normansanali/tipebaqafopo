And my parents who believed in me pursuing my passion and believed in the arts. And believed that the only way I would be happy was to live my life authentically. Thank you so much to George Furth and to Stephen Sondheim. Stephen, thank you for allowing your work to evolve and for more people to be seen in your genius.

Matty to say I’m proud of you, is an understatement. I can’t wait to watch you shine tonight on my home away from home haha&nbsp;@cbstv! Everyone watch tonight 8pm EST!”</p><p>Doyle, who is gay, talked about the struggles he faced as a teen and how his family was extremely supportive. “I was a very troubled kid and dealt with a lot of really dark thoughts and contemplated suicide when I was 13,” he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Queerty</a>. “To make sure that I was healthy throughout high school, my parents were very encouraging of my individuality and making sure that I did what I wanted.”</p><h2 id=h-he-still-had-a-tough-relationship-with-his-father>He still had a tough relationship with his father</h2><p>Even though he had supportive parents, Doyle admitted he had a strained relationship with his father. “Now, all that being said, I had a really tough relationship with my dad,” he said. “And when I came to New York, one of the reasons I wasn’t just immediately talking about it was my bigger fear of somehow upsetting my father and making him uncomfortable.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>“And that was the real hang-up for a long time — making sure that I didn’t disappoint him because I was so afraid of letting him down,” he added. “It wasn’t until I sat down and kind of had a reckoning with my dad that I was much more comfortable publicly, and able to own it and make sure that he understood that this was who I was going to be in life.”</p><p><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=#>‘The Neighborhood’: Beth Behrs Reveals Why She Peed ‘a Tiny Bit’ During a Scene With Max Greenfield [Exclusive]</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOraansV2WxKK%2Bw2auoqaemr9uucCtq2acn665pnnLnpivnaNitaqzx2aqnKCfpLluvNGopGackamybq7ErZ9mmpWdv7R5yKdko6epm8KtedOemKurXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftony-award-winner-matt-doyle-leaves-high-school-prom-date-beth-behrs-in-joyful-tears.html&text=Tony%20Award%20Winner%20Matt%20Doyle%20Leaves%20High%20School%20Prom%20Date%20Beth%20Behrs%20in%20Joyful%20Tears&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftony-award-winner-matt-doyle-leaves-high-school-prom-date-beth-behrs-in-joyful-tears.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftony-award-winner-matt-doyle-leaves-high-school-prom-date-beth-behrs-in-joyful-tears.html&title=Tony%20Award%20Winner%20Matt%20Doyle%20Leaves%20High%20School%20Prom%20Date%20Beth%20Behrs%20in%20Joyful%20Tears" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftony-award-winner-matt-doyle-leaves-high-school-prom-date-beth-behrs-in-joyful-tears.html&title=Tony%20Award%20Winner%20Matt%20Doyle%20Leaves%20High%20School%20Prom%20Date%20Beth%20Behrs%20in%20Joyful%20Tears" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftony-award-winner-matt-doyle-leaves-high-school-prom-date-beth-behrs-in-joyful-tears.html&title=Tony%20Award%20Winner%20Matt%20Doyle%20Leaves%20High%20School%20Prom%20Date%20Beth%20Behrs%20in%20Joyful%20Tears" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftony-award-winner-matt-doyle-leaves-high-school-prom-date-beth-behrs-in-joyful-tears.html&description=Tony%20Award%20Winner%20Matt%20Doyle%20Leaves%20High%20School%20Prom%20Date%20Beth%20Behrs%20in%20Joyful%20Tears" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./whats-the-meaning-of-the-name-abbott.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Whats the meaning of the name Abbott?
