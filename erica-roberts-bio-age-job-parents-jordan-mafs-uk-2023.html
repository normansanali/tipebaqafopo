On this show, Erica Roberts was one of the intruder brides taking the plunge as she married a stranger.</p><p style=text-align:left>Used to thriving at being her own boss professionally, she was struggling when it came to her own love life, which is why she hoped the experts in MAFS to help her out. In the rest of the writing, we are going to tell you all about it.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Erica Roberts On MAFS UK 2023</strong></h3><p>In the trailer of MAFS UK 2023, Erica Roberts is introduced as someone who struggled to find her “soulmate” in Edinburgh. About her, they said that after one too many “players” in the past, she now wants to say goodbye to heartbreak and hello to “the one”.</p><p style=text-align:left>Erica and personal trainer & online coach <a href=#>Jordan Gayle</a> were presented to fans as one of the intruder couples. They looked like a good match before the bride issued a warning ahead of the explosive first appearance. Before tying the knot, Erica said that she wanted to be “kept on her toes.” The ceremony went well with Jordan’s extra-long vows and they seemed to be each other’s physical types. But, shortly after, Erica recognized that Jordan had a penchant for speaking something which she said they could “tweak”. Before this explosive meeting with their fellow contestants, she gave a telling warning to her new husband saying she will probably do the opposite of what he tells her to do.</p><p>When talking about her experience on the show with RadioTimes.com, Erica also spoke about feeling the “mean girl” energy from her fellow brides.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Are Jordan Gayle And Erica Roberts Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Nevertheless, Erica, like Jordan, seemed ready to settle down, having been done with her party-girl lifestyle in London. She spoke about being at that stage where she is not interested in going out. In the past eight months, before MAFS, she said she has completely changed, has stayed indoors, has been working, going to the gym, and being a healthy “queen”. So, she said, she would love to find that one person who she can experience life with and can grow together. She said she is not anymore in that zone to do the “little situation-ships”, dating around, or meeting anyone off a dating app.</p><p>So, now the question remains: Are Jordan Gayle and Erica Roberts still together? These two have not officially confirmed nor denied if that is the case. Yet, as of October 2023, the two followed each other on Instagram and both continued to post several pictures of them together from a summer holiday with similar backgrounds.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Erica Roberts Age</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Erica Roberts was reportedly born in 1997. So, she reached the age of 26 in 2023.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Erica Roberts Height</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Brown-haired and blue-eyed Erica Roberts stands around 5’4″ in height. She also weighed around 136lbs/62kg and wore a dress size of UK 8, at the time of this writing.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Who Are Erica Roberts’s Parents?</strong></h3><p>Just lately, Erica spoke about her parents and other family members’s reactions to her going on MAFS UK.</p><p>Erica explained that her family was initially shocked but later they were a bit like “of course, you are” used to her ways of doing “something spontaneous and crazy” even in the past. So, basically, the folks ended up being “so supportive”.</p><p>Erica’s mother is Sarah Louise McEwan, a “Poochy Pamper” and “Dog Groomer” according to her <a href=#>Facebook</a>. Every now and then one can expect Erica to introduce her “beautiful mama” to her people on social media. One time on Mother’s Day, for instance, she thanked her for everything she does for her family, despite them driving her “absolutely mental”. And yet she quickly added “But how boring would life be without your famous 5.”</p><p>Erica’s father though remained unknown at this point.</p><p style=text-align:left>In her family, Erica finally also has a sister named Kyla Walker who can be found on IG&nbsp;<a href=#>@kyla_walker23.</a></p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Erica Roberts Job</strong></h3><p>After pursuing a career in dance, Erica Roberts is believed to have swapped performing for teaching and juggling her classes with her newly founded social media business.</p><p style=text-align:left>She studied at Knightswood Secondary School and Bird College before embarking on the said career. And so fast forward to 2023, she can be seen describing herself as a professional all-round performer who trained in Dance and Musical Theatre. On her official BIO, Erica also talks about being a driven, hardworking, ambitious individual who is following her dreams of becoming successful. A self-proclaimed “very open-minded, bubbly and a little bit feisty”, she loves to tell people her passions lie with, dancing, acting, and modeling.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Where Is Erica Roberts From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p style=text-align:left>Erica Roberts originally hails from&nbsp;Edinburgh, which is Scotland’s compact, hilly capital.
