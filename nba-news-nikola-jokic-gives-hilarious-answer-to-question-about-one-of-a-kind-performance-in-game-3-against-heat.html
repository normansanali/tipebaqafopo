In the 44 minutes he was on the court, Jokic scored 32 points while grabbing 21 rebounds and dishing out ten assists. His iconic performance propelled the Denver Nuggets to a<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> 109-94</a> win on the road.</p><p>On asking the Nuggets star about his epic outing, Nikola Jokic gave a causal answer, saying, ‚ÄúI mean to be honest, not much, I‚Äôm just glad we won.‚Äù This is once again a testament to how selfless of a basketball player he is. Not only did he score, but he also facilitated his teammates, who made shots in Game 3 after a disappointing outing in Game 2. The post-game walk-off was just like every other interview Jokic has given. He is unbothered by personal accomplishments being the team player he is, and does not dwell too much on them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Despite winning two MVP trophies, the Serbian hasn‚Äôt kept the individual awards a priority and always kept his team ahead.

They combined for 66 points, which was more than half of Denver‚Äôs team total on the night. Their performances made them the only teammates to have triple-doubles in the Finals.</p><p>Speaking about the duo in his post-game press conference, Nuggets coach Michael Malone said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been with Nikola for eight and Jamal for seven years now and we‚Äôve had some pretty good moments, but not in the NBA Finals and for those guys to make history the way they did tonight, no one‚Äôs ever done that.‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>"I've been with Nikola [Jokic] for 8 [years] and Jamal [Murray] for 7 years now.

The game was pretty neck and neck until the third quarter started, as things turned in the Nuggets‚Äô favor from thereon. The team from the Mile High City racked up 29 points in the third quarter and restricted the Heat to a mere 20 to turn things around. Denver put in some brilliant defensive effort and looked to have answers to everything Miami was throwing at them.</p><p>Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray were crucial for the win, but performances from Christian Braun and Aaron Gordon were also massive for the Nuggets. Heading into Game 4, coach Malone will be hoping for a similar performance from his players. If they are able to produce that, things could get complicated for the team from South Beach.</p><p><strong>In case you missed it:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZuYZqaVrMBuusikpqWZXZ%2B8rLXCZp6irpWoeqm1y5qpoqelqHqiutKwnKtlpKR6ssHErKuip55irqO71K1kqKaVYrynecBmoqKmlGK9pr7FqKmmmZ6Ysm61zWaemqWVYoBurcaaoKerpGK1pq3TaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnba-news-nikola-jokic-gives-hilarious-answer-to-question-about-one-of-a-kind-performance-in-game-3-against-heat.html&text=Nikola%20Jokic%20gives%20HILARIOUS%20ANSWER%20to%20question%20about%20one-of-a-kind%20performance%20in%20Game%203%20against%20He&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnba-news-nikola-jokic-gives-hilarious-answer-to-question-about-one-of-a-kind-performance-in-game-3-against-heat.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnba-news-nikola-jokic-gives-hilarious-answer-to-question-about-one-of-a-kind-performance-in-game-3-against-heat.html&title=Nikola%20Jokic%20gives%20HILARIOUS%20ANSWER%20to%20question%20about%20one-of-a-kind%20performance%20in%20Game%203%20against%20He" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnba-news-nikola-jokic-gives-hilarious-answer-to-question-about-one-of-a-kind-performance-in-game-3-against-heat.html&title=Nikola%20Jokic%20gives%20HILARIOUS%20ANSWER%20to%20question%20about%20one-of-a-kind%20performance%20in%20Game%203%20against%20He" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnba-news-nikola-jokic-gives-hilarious-answer-to-question-about-one-of-a-kind-performance-in-game-3-against-heat.html&title=Nikola%20Jokic%20gives%20HILARIOUS%20ANSWER%20to%20question%20about%20one-of-a-kind%20performance%20in%20Game%203%20against%20He" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnba-news-nikola-jokic-gives-hilarious-answer-to-question-about-one-of-a-kind-performance-in-game-3-against-heat.html&description=Nikola%20Jokic%20gives%20HILARIOUS%20ANSWER%20to%20question%20about%20one-of-a-kind%20performance%20in%20Game%203%20against%20He" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./school-spirits-episode-5-recap-and-ending-explained-did-claire-kill-maddie.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="School Spirits Episode 5 Recap and Ending, Explained: Did Claire Kill Maddie?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./netflix-ruthlessly-trims-the-fat-by-scrapping-2-upcoming-movies-and-cutting-jobs-in-a-division-that-literally-just-won-an-oscar-this-year.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Netflix ruthlessly trims the fat by scrapping 2 upcoming movies and cutting jobs in a division that ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
