She was chosen over 700 other potential candidates for the role of Meg Ryan’s youngest daughter in the film.&nbsp;Her first 10 years as an actress saw her appear in a few more high-profile films such as&nbsp;</span><span>Independence</span><span>&nbsp;Day and&nbsp;</span><span>One Fine Day</span><span>.&nbsp;In a career that would be heavily populated with television appearances, she began with appearances in three episodes of the cult classic,&nbsp;</span><span>Friends.</span></p><p><span>Despite the early years filled with constant acting, Mae still found time to have a childhood like everyone else, especially in education.&nbsp;She graduated from Whitefish Bay High School in Wisconsin and attended Ribet Academy in Los Angeles, California.</span></p><p><span>Like her mother, Mae Whitman’s voice is admired in the dubbing industry.&nbsp;She lent her voice to participate in an animated show,&nbsp;</span><span>Avatar: The Last Airbender,</span><span>&nbsp;voice Katara of the Water Tribe.&nbsp;She also referred to Tinker Bell in a series of Disney films about the fairy tale.&nbsp;His voice has also brought several characters to life in several video games such as&nbsp;</span><span>EverQuest II, Avatar: The Last Airbender</span><span>&nbsp;games and more recently,&nbsp;</span><span>Prey.</span></p><p><span>Due to her short stature and small voice, Mae Whitman tended to be typecast as a teenager and it was a role she played until her late twenties.</span></p><p><span>As an actress, her filmography is loaded with television appearances with roles in series like&nbsp;</span><span>Arrested Development, Rogue, Parenthood, Desperate Housewives, Grey’s Anatomy</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Family Guy</span><span>&nbsp;as a comedienne.&nbsp;She currently voices Batgirl for the&nbsp;</span><span>DC Superhero Girls.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=weightloss></span><strong><span>Weightloss</span></strong><span

DUFF,</span><span>&nbsp;a film about an “ugly fat designated friend”.&nbsp;However, the actress does not have a weight problem, although she does not fit the type of slim body model that is common around Hollywood.&nbsp;She currently has a listed weight of 58kg at a height of 5ft 1in which means she does not need to lose weight.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section
