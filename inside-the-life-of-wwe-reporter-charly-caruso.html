She had hoped to compete in the Olympics as a gymnast, but owing to injuries, she had to resign from the sport. She also wanted to play volleyball at the university level, but her height prevented her from doing so.</p><p>Caruso earned a bachelor’s degree in broadcast journalism from American University in 2010. North Central High School was her previous school.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Charly Caruso’s age, height and weight?</h2><p>Born on July 14, 1987, Caruso is 35 years old and a Cancer according to her birth sign. With her dark brown eyes and black hair, she stands at a height of 5 ft 2 inches and weighs 60 kg.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Charly Caruso’s net worth?</h2><p>Her net worth is believed to be $5 million, which she earned from her successful career.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Charly Caruso’s Nationality and Ethnicity?</h2><p>Charly is an American national and belongs to a white ethnicity.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Charly Caruso’s Profession?</h2><p>About her career, she began working as a reporter for WSAZ-TV in Huntington, West Virginia, in 2010. Charly then returned to Indianapolis to work for WXIN “Fox 59” as a freelance reporter.</p><p>She moved to WDAF-TV “Fox 4” in Kansas City, Missouri, in 2011 and worked there for two years. She returned to WXIN in 2014 to work as a sports reporter and anchor.</p><p>Charly loved covering sports, and she knew that this was her area. She has covered various top leagues, including NFL and NBA, in her career. In addition to her love for sports journalism, the entertainer is also into comedy and has given a shot at stand-up comedy. She has worked as a radio host in a comedy talk news and sports program called The Bob and Tom Show. She also created a web show named BackTalk Ball, which combines sports, entertainment, and comedy.&nbsp;</p><p>She made her debut in WWE in 2016. A close friend of hers gave her a backstage ticket to a WWE event in her home area, and at the show, she gave her resume to the WWE Senior Director of Talent Relations. Once a vacant position was available, the star auditioned and got the job. At the time, Charly had accepted another job as a sports anchor in Washington, but she chose the WWE one.&nbsp;</p><p>Her work was usually backstage as a ring announcer and as an interviewer to the wrestlers. WWE Charlie Caruso would travel a lot for her job, which was a great opportunity, but she also felt that it could be too much at times.&nbsp;</p><p>Charly currently works as a journalist for ESPN. She started working for ESPN in September 2018 on a part-time basis and had hosting spots in SportsCenter and First Take. When she first landed on the job, she shared with her fans on Instagram that she was not leaving her role in WWE, but rather, would be doing some things at ESPN occasionally.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the journalist has switched to ESPN on a full-time basis. The news regarding the switch came up on March 30, 2021. Charly Arnolt ESPN roles include contributing to SportsNation, ESPN’s weekday morning show, and other digital series, along with her previous roles in SportsCenter and First Take.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Charly Caruso married to?</h2><p>As it stands, the marital status of the sportscaster indicates that she’s single.</p><p>There was however a rumour that Caruso was in a relationship with Seth Rollins, a WWE superstar. The rumour came up after Rollins shared a photo on Twitter with a lady assumed to be Caruso. This was around the same time when Seth broke up with his ex-girlfriend Zahra Schreiber. At the time, many fans even said that Charly seemed nervous when interviewing Seth. Charly Caruso and Seth Rollins said nothing about it, and the rumour eventually died down.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Charly Caruso have children?</h2><p>There’s no information that indicates that the sportscaster has children. It is therefore assumed that she doesn’t have any children yet.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqKlrKGUmnq1tMRmo6KelWK8p3nWsJxmqpWlvLPAxKtknKCRp7m6ecKaqa6rn2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finside-the-life-of-wwe-reporter-charly-caruso.html&text=Inside%20The%20Life%20Of%20WWE%20reporter%20Charly%20Caruso&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-the-life-of-wwe-reporter-charly-caruso.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-the-life-of-wwe-reporter-charly-caruso.html&title=Inside%20The%20Life%20Of%20WWE%20reporter%20Charly%20Caruso" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finside-the-life-of-wwe-reporter-charly-caruso.html&title=Inside%20The%20Life%20Of%20WWE%20reporter%20Charly%20Caruso" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finside-the-life-of-wwe-reporter-charly-caruso.html&title=Inside%20The%20Life%20Of%20WWE%20reporter%20Charly%20Caruso" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-the-life-of-wwe-reporter-charly-caruso.html&description=Inside%20The%20Life%20Of%20WWE%20reporter%20Charly%20Caruso" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jalil-farjad.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jalil Farjad">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./giannis-antetokounmpo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Giannis Antetokounmpo - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Nationality, Body Measurement, Career">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
