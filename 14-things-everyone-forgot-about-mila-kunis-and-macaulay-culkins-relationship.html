Although they shared a special bond, it was reported that their breakup was rough on both stars. Afterward, Mila famously reconnected with her old costar from That '70s Show, Ashton Kutcher, whom she later married and started a family with. Things weren’t as easy for Macaulay - it took longer for the Home Alone star to find new love after the end of their long-term relationship.</p><p>From battles with drug addiction to cheating rumors, here are 14 things everyone forgot about Mila Kunis and Macaulay Culkin’s relationship!</p><h2 id=the-couple-dated-for-nearly-a-decade-from-2002-to-2011><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>The Couple Dated For Nearly A Decade, From 2002 To 2011</span></h2><p>Oftentimes, celebrity relationships don’t last past a few years, but there have been some couples that have stood the test of time. Although Macaulay and Mila’s relationship eventually ended in a breakup, the couple were together for nearly a decade before they decided to part ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-were-first-linked-when-mila-was-18-and-macaulay-was-21><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>They Were First Linked When Mila Was 18 And Macaulay Was 21</span></h2><p>Although the details around their first meeting are unknown, it’s safe to assume that these celebrities most likely met in Hollywood through mutual friends. By the time they began dating, Macaulay already had success as a child star, thanks to&nbsp;Home Alone, and Mila was the talked about "it girl" in That '70s Show.</p><h2 id=mila-revealed-that-the-couple-grew-up-together-because-they-began-their-relationship-as-young-adults><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Mila Revealed That The Couple Grew Up Together Because They Began Their Relationship As Young Adults</span></h2><p>We all know that fame takes a heavy toll on young celebrities in Hollywood. At the time that they met, both&nbsp;Mila and Mac were well-known to people worldwide. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview</a>, Mila revealed that they relied on one another for emotional support. They basically grew up together in the spotlight.</p><h2 id=in-the-beginning-they-were-in-a-long-distance-relationship><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>In The Beginning, They Were In A Long-Distance Relationship</span></h2><p>Mila was only 18 years old when she was first linked to Macaulay. Due to their busy acting schedules, the two were in a long-distance relationship for the first few years of their relationship. Mila was living in Los Angeles, California, while Macaulay lived in New York.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mila-described-macaulay-as-her-steady-rock><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Mila Described Macaulay As Her "Steady Rock"</span></h2><p>In certain interviews, Mila opened up by revealing details about her relationship with Macaulay. These were details that she and Mac had kept private for many years. She described the former child actor as her "steady rock." His unwavering support for the actress was all she needed to stay strong while facing critics in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=his-fame-made-it-difficult-for-the-couple-to-keep-their-relationship-private><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>His Fame Made It Difficult For The Couple To Keep Their Relationship Private</span></h2><p>At the time that Mila and Macaulay met, Macaulay had already established himself as a successful former child actor and amassed many fans worldwide.

In 2011, the couple officially called it quits. Initially, their split was considered amicable. Although there was a lot of gossip about why they broke up, there wasn’t much actual insight into why the couple parted ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mila-revealed-that-the-split-wasn-t-amicable-and-the-their-relationship-ended-badly><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Mila Revealed That The Split Wasn't Amicable And The Their Relationship Ended Badly</span></h2><p>Years after their split, Mila revealed that their breakup was<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> far from amicable</a>.&nbsp;Apparently, news outlets didn't get the true picture when they wrote stories about Mac and Mila's parting of ways. Without revealing too many details about what went down, the actress confessed that she blamed herself for the relationship ending on bad terms. She also said that it took her a long time to own up to it.</p><h2 id=their-sudden-split-was-surrounded-by-cheating-rumors-that-involved-ashton-kutcher><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Their Sudden Split Was Surrounded By Cheating Rumors That Involved Ashton Kutcher</span></h2><p>Although both actors were, at first, tight-lipped about what led to their breakup, it wasn't long before rumors started swirling. Shortly after they parted ways, Mila became romantically linked to her former costar on That ‘70s Show, Ashton Kutcher. Mila and Ashton reconnected and began dating in 2012, then married in the summer of 2015.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>18 Stunning Pics Of Mila Kunis That'll Make Every Guy Jealous Of Ashton Kutcher</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-was-reported-that-their-breakup-took-a-heavy-toll-on-macaulay><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>It Was Reported That Their Breakup Took A Heavy Toll On Macaulay</span></h2><p>Around the time that Mila became linked with Ashton, pictures of Macaulay began surfacing and the young actor undoubtedly looked less healthy than he used to.

A representative of Macaulay's<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> denied these rumors</a> and confirmed that the actor was sober.</p><h2 id=mila-is-said-to-have-reached-out-to-macaulay-during-this-time-begging-him-to-seek-treatment><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mila Is Said To Have Reached Out To Macaulay During This Time, Begging Him To Seek Treatment</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to sources close to the pair</a>, Mila allegedly reached out to her ex because of his drug addiction. The source went on to say that Mila was begging Macaulay to enter rehab and seek treatment. Although the drug addiction rumors were denied by Macaulay’s rep, it seems like his ex had reason enough to be concerned about his health.</p><h2 id=in-2015-mila-married-former-that-70s-show-costar-ashton-kutcher><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>In 2015, Mila Married Former That '70s Show Costar, Ashton Kutcher</span></h2><p>Not long after her breakup from Macaulay in 2011, Mila sparked romance rumors after being spotted with former costar, Ashton Kutcher. Ashton was newly divorced from his now ex-wife, Demi Moore, and reconnected with Mila at an awards show. Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashton tried to set her up with a friend</a>, their chemistry prevailed and the two began a relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Things Mila Kunis And The Cast Have Said About Being On That '70s Show</a></span></p><h2 id=macaulay-has-been-dating-former-disney-star-brenda-song-since-2017><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Macaulay Has Been Dating Former Disney Star, Brenda Song, Since 2017</span></h2><p>In 2017, Macaulay became linked to former Disney star, Brenda Song.
