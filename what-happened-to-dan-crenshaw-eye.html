He lost his eye during a mission to Afghanistan, but this hasn't stopped him from achieving unparalleled success. So, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what happened to his eye</a>?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This is what happened to Rep. Dan Crenshaw's eye.</h2><p>Rep. Crenshaw was first commissioned as a U.S. Navy officer in 2006. He deployed to Iraq twice. The tragedy that cost him his right eye occurred in 2012, when he was about six months into his third mission to Afghanistan. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a>, the accident took place in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, where Rep. Crenshaw and his platoon were sent on a last-minute mission.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>One of the interpreters, Raqman, crossed in front of Rep. Crenshaw just as the platoon made motions to secure a compound. Raqman stepped on a pressure plate, accidentally triggering 15 pounds worth of explosives. He suffered fatal injuries, while Rep. Crenshaw lost his right eye. According to The Washington Post, Rep. Crenshaw compared the experience to being "hit by a truck." According to the outlet, he felt as though his body "been scratched open" and "doused in Tabasco."&nbsp;</p><p>Rep. Crenshaw was put into a medically-induced coma and sent to Germany for treatment, where the remains of his right eye were scraped out, and a copper wire was removed from his right eye. Reportedly, it took him about two years to fully recover. He deployed to Bahrain and South Korea after the accident. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rep. Crenshaw previously said that he is "very self-conscious" when he wears a glass eye.</h2><p>"When I meet people in public, and especially campaigning, I noticed it's very distracting to people," Rep. Crenshaw said about the glass eye he sometimes wears in a video posted on Twitter, as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hill.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>"Even if it's a natural-looking eye, it doesn’t quite look right [...] It's extremely distracting. And I'm very self-conscious about it," he added.&nbsp;</p><p>Rep. Crenshaw prefers items adorned with the Navy SEAL trident or the bonefrog symbol. &nbsp;</p><p>"Some of the first ones I had made were actually wooden and they had certain SEALs symbols, Navy SEALs symbols — not only the trident but also what we call the bonefrog [...] So I've been wearing a lot of different eye patches for a long time," he explained in a video posted on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Over the last year, I've gotten a lot of questions about where I got my eye patch, why I wear it, and the glass eye underneath. So here is the scoop.

The one I wear the most is the Navy SEAL trident. What that actually is is a gold earring that they sell in Coronado, Calif. that we had implanted into a glass eye," he added.&nbsp;</p><p>As Rep. Crenshaw explained later on in the video, he draws a distinction between his public and private life, mostly wearing eye patches when he has to meet strangers or appear at political events.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSdmZ5isLOxzayfmq9dmsam</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-dan-crenshaw-eye.html&text=U.S.%20Representative%20Dan%20Crenshaw%20Lost%20His%20Eye%20During%20a%202012%20Mission%20to%20Afghanistan&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-dan-crenshaw-eye.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-dan-crenshaw-eye.html&title=U.S.%20Representative%20Dan%20Crenshaw%20Lost%20His%20Eye%20During%20a%202012%20Mission%20to%20Afghanistan" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-dan-crenshaw-eye.html&title=U.S.%20Representative%20Dan%20Crenshaw%20Lost%20His%20Eye%20During%20a%202012%20Mission%20to%20Afghanistan" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-dan-crenshaw-eye.html&title=U.S.%20Representative%20Dan%20Crenshaw%20Lost%20His%20Eye%20During%20a%202012%20Mission%20to%20Afghanistan" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-dan-crenshaw-eye.html&description=U.S.%20Representative%20Dan%20Crenshaw%20Lost%20His%20Eye%20During%20a%202012%20Mission%20to%20Afghanistan" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ginger-gonzaga-parents-ethnicity-is-she-still-dating-jim-carrey.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Ginger Gonzaga Ethnicity?
