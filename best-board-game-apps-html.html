It’s a sort of spiritual successor to his 1997 game Tigris & Euphrates, one of the all-time classics of area control. In both games, you score by growing your “kingdoms” in four different colors, but at game-end each player’s lowest score of those four is compared to the other players’ lowest scores. Where Tigris had players placing square tiles on a map, creating kingdoms of adjacent tiles that go to “war” when they’re connected, Yellow & Yangtze uses hexagonal tiles that allow for more connections between groups. It also introduces a fifth color of kingdoms, gold, that can be used to boost your score in any of the four other areas. Dire Wolf’s apps all look great, with bright colors and snazzy animations, and this is no exception.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjf8c0hbc00n43b60gq8ddbni@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>24.

You’re building out a colony by planting crops, constructing buildings, shipping goods either for money or points, and hiring colonists represented by … (squinting) little brown tokens. (That’s true in the physical game as well.) It’s a classic “engine builder,” where you set things up in your space to generate stuff each round, mostly trade goods you can ship for points, which is the optimal strategy unless everyone else is doing it, too.

The original version didn’t have a strong enough AI component, but the developers added a harder option last year.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjf8c1hhg00u03b60mn74wtp2@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>22.

Steam has players competing to build rail lines on any of various maps — one standard map is New England — to connect cities and towns and then ship various colored cubes across their rail lines. You get money each time a good travels along one of your tracks, regardless of who’s shipping it. There’s almost no randomness or luck involved here, making this a great game if you enjoyed that operations-research class you took in business school.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck864cks800463h66tzxgtuok@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>21.

This app version uses graphics from the newest edition, and has solid AI players that can navigate the myriad choices and strategies available to players, only lacking in the spite that actual humans can show (there are some times when blocking an opponent is the right strategy). This is a game I rarely get to the table in my house, so playing on the app is often a good way to get my fix.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjf8cr7iy01753b60im8d23lj@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>20.

The real Tōkaidō, or East Sea Road, was a major thoroughfare in Japan during the Edo period, traveled by foot and connecting Kyoto to what is now Tokyo. Players in Tokaido travel along the board, stopping wherever they wish, with each stop allowing them to do something that eventually leads to points — collecting artifacts, donating to the temple, collecting portions of artworks, or buying meals at the inns along the route. Although there are several different ways to rack up points, usually you just want to stop everywhere you can, both to gain the benefits and because you can block another player from stopping there.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck864b47100243h66u2pmpu0r@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>19.

Players will also terraform the board, placing greenery and water hex tiles — as well as the occasional city tile — on the planet, further boosting the planet’s temperature, oxygen, and water, driving the game toward the end conditions.

The app doesn’t offer multiplayer and it’s designed for you to play this solo in one sitting … but it’s super fast and so addictive that you aren’t likely to stop mid-game or to play just once. It’s a dice-roller: You’ll roll your set of six dice 18 times across six rounds, selecting and removing one die after each roll to fill in a spot on your scoresheet, which has five areas matching the colors of five of the dice. (The sixth die, the white, is wild and can be used on any color.) Filling in certain squares unlocks bonuses, including the all-powerful “plus one” ability that lets you select and score an additional die. The goal is to get the highest score you can; anything over 200 is good, and 300 is Hall of Fame material.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjf8cs1x401c33b60zotipk14@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>17.

Players take oddly shaped fabrics from a <a href=#>rondel</a> that limits choices on each turn, placing them on their nine-by-nine boards and sometimes gaining buttons, the game’s currency, to allow them to buy bigger fabric pieces or gain more choices from the board.

Everyone starts in the same space on the board with three-foot soldiers and gains a certain number of moves each turn by taking a card that grants goods as well as either movement points, military units, or the right to build a city. Scoring at the end is based on control of continents and collections of goods, with the biggest bonuses coming if you collect a lot of any one good.

You gain a second token if you matched the edge of the tile you placed to the edge it’s touching on the board. You trade in tokens in sets for points, but the point bonuses for these — one of each of the seven colors, four of a kind, or three pair — decrease over the course of the game. It’s over quick, and since you can’t control your tile draws, your strategy is really turn by turn.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck8643do300663h660edqo20m@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>14.

In Raiders, players place meeples in the port town at the bottom of the board to gain supplies and hire workers so they can outfit their longships with raiding parties to go pillage the outposts and fortresses across the top two-thirds of the map. The app brings in the outstanding, cartoonish artwork from the physical game as well.

What truly separates Galaxy Trucker from so many other adaptations is the best narrative campaign on any board-game app. This wasn’t just thrown together — someone wrote it like a short graphic novel you’ll play your way through many, many games over.

In Jaipur, each player has a hand of up to seven cards and tries to collect sets of the six goods shown on the cards, each of which has its own value. You can only take cards from the five shown in the “market” on the table. There are also camel cards, which you can use to take multiple cards at once; a popular tactic is to set up a move where you replace all of the goods cards with camels from your stack, so that your opponent has no choice but to take all five camel cards and give you a chance to choose from five fresh cards from the deck. The campaign mode tweaks various rules, like reducing the hand size to five or changing the card values so that they’re all the same.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjf8eeyrz004a3b60o98d5n4h@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>11.

Splendor players collect tokens they can use to buy any of the 12 gem cards on the table, arranged in three rows from cheapest to most expensive. The more costly a card, the more points it’s likely to be worth. Collecting certain combinations of cards — three each of three specific colors, for example — may get you a Noble tile, worth another three points. The first player to 15 points triggers the last round, and then whoever has the most points wins.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck863ysls002s3h66expatafg@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>10.

Evolution has players competing to create species and arm them with Trait cards that make them better foragers, or turn them into predators, or give them stronger defenses against other players’ carnivorous species. The physical game moves kind of slowly between turns, but it’s much faster in digital form because the app does the work for you of figuring out which species can “eat” where — and the animations when species do eat are clever.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjf8eiv2500to3b60bq108mtl@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>9.

It’s actually more enjoyable than it sounds because it’s a sort of puzzle of how to balance gaining points with the requirement that every few turns you turn in enough food to feed your family members. The huge decks of cards with occupations and additions called minor improvements gives the game replay value as well. Le Havre, a heavier game that combines elements of Agricola and Caylus, also has an app version from Codito.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck863stou00313h66w575ez0m@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>8.

There are four diseases spreading around the world and you have to find cures while slowing their progress across the map. If eight outbreaks occur, or you run out of cards in the player deck, you lose; if you cure all four before that, you win. You can customize the difficulty level as you’d like, including Heroic and Legendary modes if you enjoy losing. The On the Brink expansion is available as an in-app purchase, adding new player roles and event cards, plus a new challenge. There are also app versions of two similar games from the same designer, Forbidden Island and Forbidden Desert; the latter is especially good as a solo endeavor that remains difficult, but moves faster than Pandemic.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjf8ejwgr01423b60n9zfw4p4@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>7.

Not only are the AI players good but the developers managed to cram a lot of information onto even the smaller screens of phones, allowing you to zoom in on any card easily enough to read the icons, making opponents’ actions clear, and giving you plenty of chances to undo certain moves if you screw up. On a tablet, it’s just about perfect. And I can confirm that I have beaten AI players using a different strategy by going full military … but it wasn’t easy.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjf8ewo3n01iw3b60nxjdakdg@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>6.

It even has a legitimately funny joke buried within it. Through the Ages is a 4X (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) style game played out with cards, where you try to build a civilization, complete wonders for points, beat opponents with your military, improve your government, and ensure that your workers don’t riot. There is a lot going on in this game, and too much accounting for my tastes, but the app takes care of that stuff for you, so you can focus just on playing the game itself. It also has built-in warnings if your workers are going to riot or you’re going to lose resources before the next turn. The false 3-D perspective also helps them cram a lot of buildings onto your screen without crowding it. Games against AI players take 20-plus minutes, more than anything else on this list, but there’s very little downtime involved.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck863qj3k021m3h66x7oas71x@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>5.

Istanbul is a route-finding game that manages not to feel like too much of a route-finding game: You move your merchant around the four-by-four board, with each space allowing you to perform some specific function, like collecting goods, selling them for coins, upgrading your caravan, or trading goods or coins for rubies, which is the actual goal of the game. The first player to get five rubies (six, if you’re playing with just two players) wins. It’s clear, moves quickly, and the AI players are impressive, especially with how well they adapt to randomized boards. Acram’s port of Charterstone, a competitive legacy game for up to six players, should be released shortly as well.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjf8fjpbd01qc3b609nz9kphi@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>4.

Both feature outstanding graphics, easy-to-follow play on tablets or phones, and competent AI opponents. They also worked particularly well for pass-and-play, with Small World — later updated and dubbed Small World 2 — including a feature that allows two players to face each other across a table and play on a tablet without having to exchange or rotate it. Small World is an area control map where there just isn’t enough room on the map for all of the players. You pick a race, grab some territories, and then put your race into “decline,” so you can pick a brand-new race and start all over again. It’s bloody good fun for the whole family — and the app takes care of the one small hassle of the physical game, tallying up points each turn.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjf8foky202o53b60d9lvsz9n@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>3.

Its license for the game expired at the beginning of March, however, and it’s no longer available to purchase; there is currently no iOS port of this game, although I assume one is coming soon. In the meantime, you can play Asmodee Digital’s version on Android devices and Steam. This version offers players an isometric view instead, which gives the tiles some texture, although you can switch to top-down if you prefer that. The iOS app is cleaner to look at, while the Asmodee version offers more animations to give it more of the feel of a video game. There are four AI opponents: a “focused” AI, a builder, an aggressive opponent, and a “conqueror.” There are six in-app purchases available, including what I think is the best expansion for the board game itself, Traders & Builders.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjf8fmoon021u3b60h02un2pb@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>2.

The base game is my go-to recommendation for readers who ask for a game that they can play with their kids because the rules are simple, the scoring is easy to understand, and QED train games are awesome. The app’s tutorial is good, the animations and graphics are excellent, and the user interface is intuitive. (You’d be surprised how often board-game apps screw that last part up.) The Ticket to Ride app offers Europe, Switzerland, Nordic countries, England, Germany, Asia, India, and Pennsylvania maps as expansion options, as well as new card sets like the 1910 and 1912 sets for the U.S. There’s also a version for younger players, Ticket to Ride First Journey, as a separate app, which is also quite good.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjf8fnkqy02ci3b60ws3naz0k@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>1. 7 Wonders (Repos Production/Outer Zone Entertainment)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e2d/18b/27edb64306809e57499669857cc0c78a97-agricola.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjf8fntcb02ep3b60i35y9drl@published data-word-count=218>The 7 Wonders app appeared in November after years of anticipation, delays, and testing … and it was worth the wait. 7 Wonders itself is one of the best board games we’ve seen because it condenses the city-building theme into a consistent 30-minute playing time. Each player gets a hand of seven cards per round, plays one, and then passes the remaining cards to the next player, who selects one from his or her hand and passes the remainder around … so that everyone plays six cards per round (discarding one), but the cards you get to choose from keep changing as the hands move around the table. You do this three times, playing 18 cards, building a little engine that gives you the resources and coins you’ll need to play more buildings or complete your Wonder. There are lots of ways to score, so part of the game is finding a path to points that your opponents aren’t following. Moves are simultaneous, so solo games fly by on the app, although it can be tough to follow what all opponents are doing, AI or real, if you’re playing against more than three other players. The developer just added the Leaders expansion as a $1.99 in-app purchase. It’s a tremendous game that finally got the app it deserved.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>The 25 Best Board-Game Mobile Apps to Play Right Now</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyjsdKtZJunkaexbrPAppxmmaClwG%2B006aj</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-board-game-apps-html.html&text=The%2025%20Best%20Board-Game%20Mobile%20Apps%20to%20Play%20Right%20Now&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-board-game-apps-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-board-game-apps-html.html&title=The%2025%20Best%20Board-Game%20Mobile%20Apps%20to%20Play%20Right%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-board-game-apps-html.html&title=The%2025%20Best%20Board-Game%20Mobile%20Apps%20to%20Play%20Right%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-board-game-apps-html.html&title=The%2025%20Best%20Board-Game%20Mobile%20Apps%20to%20Play%20Right%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-board-game-apps-html.html&description=The%2025%20Best%20Board-Game%20Mobile%20Apps%20to%20Play%20Right%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./youtuber-annabelle-ham-death-at-22-circumstances-tragic.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Circumstances Surrounding YouTuber Annabelle Ham's Death At 22 Are Truly Tragic">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sony-bravia-x93l-4k-tv-review.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sony Bravia X93L mini-LED TV review: lower-cost luxury">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
