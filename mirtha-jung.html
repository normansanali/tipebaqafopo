While most people reach stardom due to excellence in their field, few rise to fame out of sheer notoriety, George Jung is one of those guys. George rose to fame as a drug lord and smuggler who played a major part in the drug trade in the United States in the 1970s and early 1980s. While everything about George is on the media for all to see, details on his personal life are hard to come by. And one of those details is George’s marriage to his ex-wife, Mirtha Jung. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Mirtha Jung.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life:</h2><p>Mirtha Calderon Del Val was born on the 3rd of December 1952 in Cuba. As a young kid, Mirtha had a troubling childhood. Born and raised in a Cuban neighborhood, Mirtha did not have the best of environment to nurture her talents. So, Mirtha turned to drugs to solve the problem. From her early teen years, Mirtha was knee-deep into drugs, which was also how she met and married George Jung.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/George-Jung-ex-wife-Mirtha-Jung.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meeting George:</h2><p>Mirtha met George during her early 20s. George was already a notorious drug lord and Mirtha was already addicted to it. The pair met through a mutual friend and instantly took to each other. Around the time, George, Ochoa Vazquez brothers, Jorge Luis, Juan David, Fabio, Pablo Escobar, Carlos Lehder, and Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, were all part of the Medellin cartel.</p><p>The pair got married in 1977 Mirtha was 25 at the time and was already well-versed in the cartel’s routes and operations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Shouldering her husband’s crimes:</h2><p>After their marriage, Mirtha quickly climbed through the ranks of the cartels and stood on equal footing with her husband. Over the years, Mirth helped George to carry out his operation in the United States. After all, while George was a wanted face in the United States, Mirtha was relatively unknown. This allowed the Medellin cartel to use Mirtha as the spearhead for their operations in the states.</p><p>While Mirtha was quite clever in her operations, she couldn’t stop using drugs. She continued the habit even when she was pregnant with her only daughter, <a href=#>Kristina Sunshine Jung</a>. This caused a serious rift between George and Mirtha which later converted into a divorce.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Shouldering punishments:</h2><p>As the United States began cracking on the drug trade, the power and influence of the Medellin Cartel continued to reduce. This meant that George and Mirtha were in greater danger of being arrested and incarcerated. The pair had their house raided and George simply ran away and the baby was kept under the care of government authority for the time being. As the man himself puts it,</p><p>“Yeah, that was terrible. You know, I mean, they took the baby out of the crib and took it away and–you know, my house was invaded, ripped apart. That was really the end of it, you know.”</p><p>Following the raid, Mirth was arrested and incarcerated for her crimes. As the pair had already divorced in 1984, Mirtha decided to leave drugs behind her and start a new life. The only time she made an appearance in the media was in 2001 for the premiere of the movie, BLOW: How a Small-Town Boy Made $100 Million with the Medellin Cartel and Lost It All.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What happened to George Jung?</h2><p>George Jung was an American drug trafficker and smuggler who became famous for his involvement in the cocaine trade in the 1970s and 1980s. He was born on August 6, 1942, in Boston, Massachusetts.</p><p>Jung’s criminal career began in the 1960s when he started smuggling marijuana from California to New England. He soon became one of the largest marijuana traffickers in the country, making millions of dollars from his illegal activities.</p><p>In the 1970s, Jung began importing cocaine from Colombia to the United States, working with the notorious Medellin Cartel. He was responsible for smuggling large amounts of cocaine into the country, and his operation made him a multimillionaire. He was known for his flamboyant lifestyle, which included expensive cars, mansions, and private jets.</p><p>Jung was eventually arrested in 1994 and sentenced to 60 years in prison. However, he cooperated with the authorities and testified against other members of the Medellin Cartel, which reduced his sentence to 20 years. He was released from prison in 2014.</p><p>Jung’s life story was the inspiration for the 2001 movie “Blow,” starring Johnny Depp as Jung. The movie chronicled his rise and fall as a drug trafficker and smuggler, as well as his relationship with his father and daughter.</p><p>Jung passed away on May 5, 2021, at the age of 78. Despite his criminal activities, he remains a controversial figure in the world of drug trafficking, and his life story continues to fascinate and intrigue people to this day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wiki/Bio Facts:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=0.89908256880734><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Mirtha Calderon Del Val</td></tr><tr><td>Birthdate</td><td>December 3, 1952</td></tr><tr><td>Birthplace</td><td>&nbsp;Cuba</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Cuban</td></tr><tr><td>Sexuality</td><td>Straight</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Divorced</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Husband</td><td>George Jung (m.1977-1984)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td><a href=#>Kristina Sunshine Jung</a></td></tr><tr><td>Zodiac</td><td>Sagittarius</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGikoqqkna5uttSnnmg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmirtha-jung.html&text=What%20happened%20to%20George%20Jung%20ex-wife%20Mirtha%20Jung%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmirtha-jung.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmirtha-jung.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20George%20Jung%20ex-wife%20Mirtha%20Jung%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmirtha-jung.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20George%20Jung%20ex-wife%20Mirtha%20Jung%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmirtha-jung.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20George%20Jung%20ex-wife%20Mirtha%20Jung%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmirtha-jung.html&description=What%20happened%20to%20George%20Jung%20ex-wife%20Mirtha%20Jung%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./where-is-puka-nacua-from-college.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where is Puka Nacua from college?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-botany-bay-hotel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Botany Bay Hotel Review, Broadstairs, Kent, England">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
