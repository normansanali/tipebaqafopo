The student’s mother, Leah Paske, posted the video, which went viral, mentioning that her “super sweet child” often ate alone.</p><p>“I asked if I could sit next to him, and he said ‘Sure, why not?'” Rudolph stated to reporters in 2016. “I just felt like we had a great conversation. He started off and was so open. He told me his name was Bo and how much he loves Florida State, and he went from there.”</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmidqKqdmr9uusWlZKmkka6ys3nTq5ivoaNiv7awzqWnoWWWpMKvsIynpq1ll6q2rcDYZqafZZ2qv6Wx0WaYrGWaqr%2B6ecCgqZ6dXZ2ybq3CrZydZZmjerSxy59knZ2Wmru0sYyipWZqYGd%2BbrLArZilZaOdvLDAyKeeaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fformer-nfl-player-travis-rudolph-found-not-guilty-of-murder-as-jury-agree-he-acted-in-self-defense-in-2021-fatal-shooting.html&text=Former%20NFL%20player%2c%20Travis%20Rudolph%20found%20not%20guilty%20of%20murder%20as%20jury%20agree%20he%20acted%20in%20self-defense%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fformer-nfl-player-travis-rudolph-found-not-guilty-of-murder-as-jury-agree-he-acted-in-self-defense-in-2021-fatal-shooting.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fformer-nfl-player-travis-rudolph-found-not-guilty-of-murder-as-jury-agree-he-acted-in-self-defense-in-2021-fatal-shooting.html&title=Former%20NFL%20player%2c%20Travis%20Rudolph%20found%20not%20guilty%20of%20murder%20as%20jury%20agree%20he%20acted%20in%20self-defense%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fformer-nfl-player-travis-rudolph-found-not-guilty-of-murder-as-jury-agree-he-acted-in-self-defense-in-2021-fatal-shooting.html&title=Former%20NFL%20player%2c%20Travis%20Rudolph%20found%20not%20guilty%20of%20murder%20as%20jury%20agree%20he%20acted%20in%20self-defense%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fformer-nfl-player-travis-rudolph-found-not-guilty-of-murder-as-jury-agree-he-acted-in-self-defense-in-2021-fatal-shooting.html&title=Former%20NFL%20player%2c%20Travis%20Rudolph%20found%20not%20guilty%20of%20murder%20as%20jury%20agree%20he%20acted%20in%20self-defense%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fformer-nfl-player-travis-rudolph-found-not-guilty-of-murder-as-jury-agree-he-acted-in-self-defense-in-2021-fatal-shooting.html&description=Former%20NFL%20player%2c%20Travis%20Rudolph%20found%20not%20guilty%20of%20murder%20as%20jury%20agree%20he%20acted%20in%20self-defense%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kathryn-newton.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Netflix's The Society Actress, Kathryn Newton Dating?
