She has a <strong>net worth</strong> of $5 million as of 2022.</p><h2><span id=Career_and_Professional_Life>Career and Professional Life</span></h2><p>Marissa Nadler is a musician, singer-songwriter, and fine artist. She has been active since the year 2000 and is currently signed to Sacred Bones Records and Bella Union.</p><p>The musician released her eighth full-length studio album called <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">For My Crimes </a>in September 2018.</p><p>Likewise, her music is characterized as blending traditional folk, Gothic Americana, and dreamy pop into an original musical framework.</p><p>Her music is rooted in old-school country and folk. However, it brings in elements of experimental and black metal. Sometimes the term “dream folk” is also invoked to describe her work.</p><p>Furthermore, she has received acclaim for her vocals by singing as a mezzo-soprano.</p><p>Pitchfork described the singer’s voice as one “you would follow straight into Hades” and also “textured and angelic, with just a hint of pain captured within her iridescent falsetto”.</p><h2><span id=The_Beginning>The Beginning</span></h2><p>During her studies, Marissa began to perform at open mic events around Providence.</p><p>While exploring artistic techniques like illustration, painting, bookbinding, wood carving, and encaustic painting, she also honed her songwriting craft.</p><p>Young subsequently recorded an album titled Autumn Rose as well as the four-track EP Somber Ghost Recordings.</p><p>However, both of them have never been released.

However, it was her 2007 album Songs III: Bird on the Water that put her on the global map. I</p><p>t also drew the attention of musicians ranging from black metallers Xasthur to indie rockers Xiu Xiu.</p><p>Likewise, her 2016 album Strangers is a second collaboration with producer Randall Dunn.</p><p>This work represented an expansion of her songwriting as it moved away from primarily first-person confessional narratives to character-driven, episodic tomes.</p><p>Nadler’s compositions sound otherworldly, even timeless. The musician’s first two albums are Ballads of Living and Dying and The Saga of Mayflower May.</p><p>These albums were largely acoustic affairs that featured her mezzo-soprano voice and guitar accompanied by banjo, bells, and penny whistles.</p><p>In Songs III: Bird on the Water, the musician used synthesizers for the first time as well as strings and harp.</p><p>With 2009’s Little Hells, she began opening up her sound to include percussion, pianos, Wurlitzer, and standard rock instrumentation.</p><p>The musician toured almost constantly and gained global acclaim for her recordings and performances.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-85921 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Marissa-Nadler-captured-while-performing-at-ECLAT-SCHORNDORF.jpg alt="Marissa Nadler" width=650 height=433 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-85921 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Marissa captured while performing at ÉCLAT SCHORNDORF.

This album featured studio appearances from Eyvind Kang, Phil Wandscher, and others.</p><p>Then in 2016, she and Dunn collaborated again on Strangers. Throughout her 2017 tour of America, she began writing numerous tracks centered on the tension that distance creates in relationships.</p><p>During her time at the House of Lux studio in Laurel Canyon, the musician was given a lot of creative freedom and chose to work with accomplished female musicians throughout the recording process</p><p>, including notable guests like Sharon Van Etten, Angel Olsen, and harpist Mary Lattimore.</p><p>She released the resulting album, For My Crimes, in September 2018.
