He died in his home in DeSoto County, Mississippi, which is south of Memphis. No cause of death was given at the time, though Lewis was reportedly in poor health for quite a while.</p><p id=par-3_55>Lewis was known for pushing the envelope, which got him into trouble throughout his lifetime. His hit, “Whole Lotta Shakin’,” was initially banned from radio stations due to its suggestive nature. And audiences loved the aggressive way he attacked his piano while playing. Lewis reclaimed his childhood nickname, “the Killer,” thanks to how he played.</p><p id=par-4_42>“Nobody had a more creative approach to the music or a more incendiary approach to performing it,” Peter Guralnick, an Elvis Presley biography author, said of Lewis. “He had the ability to put his stamp on every kind of material he recorded.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What was Jerry Lee Lewis’ net worth at the time of his death?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jerry-Lee-Lewis-1.jpg><p id=par-5_19>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Jerry Lee Lewis’ net worth at the time of his death was $10 million.</p><p id=par-6_67>Lewis didn’t grow up with money, of course. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>, he worked as a “sewing machine salesman” before making it big with music — though he didn’t exactly sell the machines. He told customers that they won the machines and only had to pay him $10 for tax. By the time he was discovered to be lying, he made a bit of money for himself.</p><p id=par-7_66>In 1955, he went to Nashville hoping to strike a record deal, but he failed. Thankfully, in 1956, he signed on with the label Sun Records in Memphis. He sold 300,000 copies of his rendition of Ray Price’s “Crazy Arms” that same year. Lewis continued to work as a solo artist for the label, and he was also featured with many other musicians from Sun Records.</p><p id=par-8_43>Later in his career, Lewis found success with country music. Celebrity Net Worth notes he found a hit after releasing a version of Jerry Chestnut’s “Another Place, Another Time.” From 1968 to 1977, he found great success on the Billboard country music charts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>His marriage to 13-year-old Myra Gale Brown destroyed his career at the time</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_57>Jerry Lee Lewis died with an impressive net worth, but he nearly lost it all due to one of his marriages. In 1958, he toured Britain with his <a href=#>13-year-old wife, Myra Gale Brown</a>, The Guardian reports. At the time, he was 22 years old, and the marriage shocked reporters. To make matters worse, Brown was Lewis’ cousin.</p><p id=par-10_46>The taboo marriage resulted in Lewis getting shunned from concerts. He reportedly went from earning $10,000 per night to earning just $250. While this marriage certainly affected his net worth, Lewis continued on with music until he eventually found success again with the country music scene.</p><p id=par-11_15>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3pr7RsmSlnZViuabDyKxkp52kYsSwvtOhZK2hnZp6pbHArZ9noKSiuXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjerry-lee-lewis-net-worth-time-death-html.html&text=Jerry%20Lee%20Lewis%27%20Net%20Worth%20at%20the%20Time%20of%20His%20Death&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjerry-lee-lewis-net-worth-time-death-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjerry-lee-lewis-net-worth-time-death-html.html&title=Jerry%20Lee%20Lewis%27%20Net%20Worth%20at%20the%20Time%20of%20His%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjerry-lee-lewis-net-worth-time-death-html.html&title=Jerry%20Lee%20Lewis%27%20Net%20Worth%20at%20the%20Time%20of%20His%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjerry-lee-lewis-net-worth-time-death-html.html&title=Jerry%20Lee%20Lewis%27%20Net%20Worth%20at%20the%20Time%20of%20His%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjerry-lee-lewis-net-worth-time-death-html.html&description=Jerry%20Lee%20Lewis%27%20Net%20Worth%20at%20the%20Time%20of%20His%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./li-bing-bing-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Li Bing Bing Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jenny-mccarthy-is-freaking-out-about-frigid-nye-temps.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jenny McCarthy Is 'Freaking Out' About Frigid NYE Temps">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
