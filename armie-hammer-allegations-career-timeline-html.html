Effie, who declined to share her last name citing concerns about harassment, launched the ongoing LAPD investigation after sharing her claims on her Instagram story in early 2021. At present, she is the only woman to publicly allege that Hammer raped her. Though she did not participate in the series, her claims appear throughout via Instagram screenshots and a clip of the 2021 press conference where she alleges, in tears, that Hammer raped her in April 2017. “The way they’ve been exploiting my trauma is disgusting,” she <a href=#>says</a>. “When I keep screaming ‘no’ and they keep going, saying they don’t need my permission, they remind me of Armie.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7t88h0k000o3b6wpj9mg151@published data-word-count=121>Elli Hakami and Julian Hobbs, the duo who began working on the show soon after the LAPD began investigating the actor, say that they did not interview Effie because they wanted to allow her case to play out and not get involved in an active investigation. They argue that they include Effie’s screenshots and videos because it’s “critically important” to the story and the timeline of events as the “match that lit the fire.” “We feel we actually have an obligation to tell the stories,” they tell the <a href=#>L.A. Times</a>. “If you were to stop making films because someone said they didn’t want a film being made, you would never make a film. The reality is not everyone gets onboard films.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7t5l5jl000s3b6vvzd4xteu@published data-word-count=185><strong>September 7, 2022: </strong>The docuseries faces criticism after they use an image of an alleged bite mark onscreen. Accuser Courtney Vucekovich details her interactions with Hammer over a photo of what she claims to be a mark obtained during sexual acts — which include BDSM and biting. “I think Armie took that picture,” Vucekovich says over the image. “He bites really hard. And he tells you to wear them like a badge of honor, almost like he convinced me I’m lucky to have it.” Viewers began to question the veracity of the image when some noticed that the mark resembles a picture of a bite tattoo found on Pinterest. Following the speculation over the image’s authenticity, Discovery + replaced it with another photo provided by Vucekovich. “We take seriously the responsibility of representing victims’ stories,” a rep for Talos Films, the production company behind the series, told <a href=#>People</a> on September 6. “When new information came forward about this series we immediately began investigating it and will make any appropriate changes as quickly as possible.” Vulture has reached out to House of Hammer reps for comment.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7t5l5jn000t3b6vehb3pf8q@published data-word-count=141>In response to the bite-mark snafu, Vucekovich explains that the photo mistakenly ended up in the docuseries because it was archived in her text thread with the Call Me By Your Name actor. “When you are love-bombed, you receive multiple images in rapid succession,” she tells <a href=#>People</a>. “During my time with Armie, I received numerous messages, including countless images and videos. The bite mark shown was a photo sent by Armie within our archived text thread and over a year later, I believed it to have been a photo of me given that I have dozens of photos depicting his abuse on my body.” Andrew Brettler, a lawyer for Hammer, denies all allegations of misconduct and maintains that the actor’s relationships were “completely consensual, discussed and agreed upon in advance, and mutually participatory,” per a September 4 statement to <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9q7qcyw000p3b6x388gfac8@published data-word-count=85><strong>October 26, 2022:﻿ </strong>Hammer needs to put some serious alleged work in at the alleged time-share job, because American Express says he owes over $60 grand. <a href=#>People</a> reports that the credit-card company is suing Hammer for $66,935.07 of unpaid “purchases, balance transfers, and/or cash advances” on his account. He opened the account in 2011. According to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, the account with the almost $67,000 unpaid statement was co-owned with Elizabeth Chambers, and that “it’ll be resolved as they iron out the final details of the divorce.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cldtbahog000b3b6wiyjkowdg@published data-word-count=108><strong>February 6, 2023: </strong>In an <a href=#>interview with Air Mail</a>, his first in two years, the disgraced actor admits to being emotionally abusive but maintains that his sexual encounters were consensual. He claims that Effie, who accused him of rape, planned “all of the details” of the alleged rape over Facebook Messenger, which he describes as a “consensual non-consent” scene. Although Hammer says there was an “imbalance of power” in his relationships with accusers Courtney Vucekovich and Paige Lorenze, he denies their respective allegations of bodily harm and grooming. He then alleges a pastor sexually abused him at the age of 13, which led to his interest in BDSM.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cldtcivt0000l3b6wdh8do1po@published data-word-count=101>Job-wise, he says he’s working as a sober companion after his time-share gig last summer got him “sucked into an immigration investigation” over his nonexistent work permit. In his own words: “My financial status is I am not only broke; I am massively in debt.” After the allegations surfaced, he claims he attempted suicide while quarantining in the Cayman Islands in 2021. That same year, he says Elizabeth Chambers asked her estranged husband to do a psycho-legal evaluation. In the report, obtained by Air Mail, Chambers alleges that Hammer groomed girls as young as 15 and describes him as a “psychopath.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cldvsaazg000b3b6wnf4rjqhq@published data-word-count=100><strong>February 7, 2023: </strong>Elizabeth Chambers says she learned about the cannibalism and sex-abuse allegations against Hammer at the same time as the public. “I was like, ‘There are no words. What the fuck?’” she tells <a href=#>Elle</a> in an interview. Chambers declines to comment on Hammer’s Air Mail interview, his sexual interests, or their own sex life. “I support Armie through his journey and I always will,” she says, though she often thinks about how this will affect their children’s lives. “Do I want my son to become this? Would I want my daughter to stay in a relationship like this?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clic9njzt000f3b6weltp421p@published data-word-count=120><strong>May 31, 2023: </strong>The LA District Attorney’s office issues a statement that it will not be pursuing charges of sexual assault against Hammer. “Due to the complexity of the relationship and inability to prove a non-consensual, forcible sexual encounter we are unable to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt,” the statement, obtained by <a href=#>CNN</a>, read. Hammer responded to the news on his <a href=#>Instagram</a>, writing “I am very grateful to the District Attorney for conducting a thorough investigation and coming to the conclusion that I have stood by this entire time, that no crime was committed. I look forward to beginning what will be a long, difficult process of putting my life back together now that my name is cleared.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljqdl6kx000f3b6y3bmf0mt0@published data-word-count=78><strong>July 5, 2023: </strong>Three years after announcing their separation, almost to the day, Elizabeth Chambers and Armie Hammer are divorced. <a href=#>TMZ</a> reports that Hammer will be paying $1500 a month is child support, but that he has no income at the moment.

His camera is trained on a laptop playing a clip of a man running beside a horse. The actor’s entire profile is completely scrubbed, save for the new, singular post on his grid. When pop stars play these kinds of Instagram games, it means they’re revving up for a new era. It’s unclear if Hammer’s video has a hidden message, though.
