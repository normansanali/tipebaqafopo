And coming from all kinds of different cultures, all while being exposed to many more diverse eating habits and dishes, celebrities do take pride in being able to come up with their own creations, or recommend them for those who want to try something new.</p><p>The amount of celebrities who have cookbooks, or are passionate about cooking might be surprising to many fans, but there are indeed so many out there! And yes, sometimes these cookbooks might run the risk of being too detached from reality, i.e a normal household does not have the pantry that the Kardashians have. But other cookbooks contain plenty of recipes that are not only delicious and give fans an insight to what their favorite celebrities love to eat, but are also full of heart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=back-to-the-kitchen-by-freddie-prinze-jr-should-get-all-fans-of-great-cooking-back-to-the-kitchen><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Back to the Kitchen By Freddie Prinze Jr. Should Get All Fans Of Great Cooking Back To The Kitchen</span></h2><p>Aside from being the son of adored comedian Freddie Prinze, fans know and love Freddie Prinze Jr. from his days as a full time 90s and 2000s heartthrob. The actor shot to fame after I Know What You Did Last Summer, She's All That, and the Scooby-Doo films.<a href=#> He's also been married to the brilliant actress Sarah Michelle Geller since 2002</a> and the happy couple share two kids together.</p><p>Out of the actor's endless career achievements, the one that caught fans out of left field is the launch of his quite elaborate cookbook. The actor has successfully published Back to the Kitchen: 75 Delicious, Real Recipes (& True Stories) from a Food-Obsessed Actor, co-authored by Rachel Wharton, and it has a forward written by the actor's wife, Sarah Michelle Gellar. Turns out, Prinze Jr. is a skilled home cook, and learned it all from the life lessons his mother gave him, which always happened near a stove.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chrissy-teigen-has-all-her-fans-39-cravings-covered><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Chrissy Teigen Has All Her Fans' Cravings Covered</span></h2><p>Chrissy Teigen is a famed model, and her career as an established fashionista is what allowed her to make a name for herself in the modeling and entertainment world.
