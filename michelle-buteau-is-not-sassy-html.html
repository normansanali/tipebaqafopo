She’s becoming an increasingly familiar face, having appeared on <i>Last Comic Standing</i>, <i>The Late Late Show</i>, VH1’s <i>Best Week Ever</i>, and <i>Key & Peele</i>. I talked to Buteau about her family life, hyper-sensitivity in comedy, and what it’s like to start doing comedy three days after 9/11.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5v60x5oqr842tto91pi@published data-word-count=3><b>Happy belated birthday!</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5v60x5pqr8459dlx7hw@published data-word-count=8>Oh, thank you!

He has someone to cook his dinner and suck his dick for the rest of his life. He’s a good-natured type of person. He’s not even the type of guy who’s like, “Ooh, are you going to make this joke about me?” He just doesn’t want me to talk about his penis when he’s there. When we first started dating, I would have him come to a show, make him stand up, and have people clap for his foreskin. He let me know that we needed to set boundaries.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5v60x5sqr84medez0gx@published data-word-count=46><b>That’s fair.

Fortunately, there’s a lot of restrictions in the Netherlands, so they can’t always watch it, which works in my favor. But they’re fine with it. The Netherlands is a really cool place where you could be a doctor or a DJ and they’re like, “It’s the same kind of job. You’re serving people.” They’re weirdly liberal and fine with things. Or maybe they’re dead inside and don’t have any feelings left.

I actually started three days after September 11th. I was editing for the local news for a really long time, in college and right out of college. I was working the overnight shift. Then 9/11 happened and all of the sudden I was working 16-18 hour shifts editing very gruesome video. NBC offered us therapy. I was like, “No, I’m good. I’m going to do comedy.” It was great. I’ve been doing it ever since. For a really long time, I would support myself working the overnight shift at WNBC while doing comedy. I did both for a really long time and kind of paid my dues, but it was definitely worth it. Also, in hindsight, I should have done comedy <i>and</i> taken therapy. Live and learn.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5v60x5yqr84plh1c59s@published data-word-count=28><b>Post-9/11 was a tough time for even established comics.

Although a lot of established comedians had these really well crafted jokes about Al Qaeda and George Bush, I didn’t have any of that. When you first start comedy, you’re a guy who wants to talk about blowjobs, or a girl who’s self-deprecating, or a new comic who wants to curse a lot. My stuff was just very personal and about me and was a departure from anything 9/11 related. I lived it all night and day at work. I just wanted to talk about whatever my jokes were at the time. I think it was good for me and good for them.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5v60x60qr84bhsd24ev@published data-word-count=43><b>With the assortment of different TV roles you’ve had – you’ve been on various talk shows, talking head shows on VH1, recently you were on </b><b><i>The Jim Gaffigan Show</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>@Midnight</i> – do you find yourself getting recognized more when you go out?</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5v60x61qr846u8hw39g@published data-word-count=203>Yeah, I am. It’s really fun too. It’s always one of two things: People will either know exactly right away what they recognize me from and say, “Oh, I loved when you said this,” and I don’t really remember what I say half the time, or they’ll say, “Don’t I know you from somewhere?” It’s really interesting. I feel like what I get recognized for the most are a couple of <i>Key & Peele</i> sketches I did. Those guys are so amazing. Everything they do is kind of timeless and people watch it over and over and over again. A lot of times when I go out, people will go, “Delete the picture, motherfucker,” or yell a phrase I said. I also did this thing for <i>Best Week Ever</i> called “Panties On, Panties Off,” where it was like a thumbs up/thumbs down thing, but for pop culture. Panties off would be a good thing, Isaac, heyyyy. Panties on would be like, “No, I don’t want it.” One time this officer came up to me and I was like, “What the fuck did I do?” She was like, “Yo, I love that panties shit,” and walked away. I was like, “Okay! I’ve made it.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5v60x62qr84o3ix48sw@published data-word-count=39><b>A lot of articles I read about you labeled you as “sassy.” I’ve talked to other comics who dislike that adjective, because they feel it’s just a nicer way of saying “bitchy.” How do you feel about that label?</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5v60x63qr84gkt91vgm@published data-word-count=81>Oh my God, I will gladly take “sassy bitch,” the whole phrase.

I’ve seen a lot of young, newer comics doing mics now who are so hyper-sensitive to every label, name, and social issue. It kind of stifles their comedy and makes it harder for other comics to go up and take risks for fear of being instantly critiqued when just introducing a word or premise. Before they can even get to the point it’s like, “Oh, they just said ____ so we’re shutting down.”</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzej5v60x69qr847163wb1g@published data-word-count=144>I know. It’s so sad. It’s like everybody having allergies now. Like, “Oh God, when did this happen?” If they really do love comedy and want to make a mark and find their voice, then they have to realize that they need to let that shit go, because no one is ever going to remember what you said. You’ll never strike a chord, for better or for worse, if you’re constantly worried about what people are thinking all the time. You just have to live your life. I feel bad for them sometimes. I’ve had a fully functioning adult life without the internet, so I don’t know what’s it’s like for 100 people to come down on me because I said this one word.

It’s taken me about four years to put it all together. There’s obviously some stuff about my husband, but there’s also some stuff I do when I perform at storytelling shows that I can’t do at straight-up standup shows, because you only have 12-15 minutes. It was really nice to have the opportunity to do something else to show another layer and let the set breathe. It was super, super fun. I know that taping albums can become stressful, because you just want people to show up. A lot of times in New York it’s always the same fans and friends that come to support. But it’s also important to have a really big audience. I couldn’t have asked for a better night.
