Don't believe us? Here's everything you need to know about <a href=#>Hilaria Baldwin's parents</a> and upbringing, and what she's saying about her identity in 2021.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who are Hilaria Baldwin's parents?</h2><p>Hilaria Baldwin, born Hayward-Thomas, who recently admitted that her real first name is Hillary, has been heard for years speaking in Spanish accents and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even appeared</a> on the Today Show struggling to find the English word for "cucumber."</p><p>What's more, her profile in leading Spanish magazine Hola! describes Hilaria as having been "born in Spain" and speaking Spanish as her mother tongue.</p><p>Her story, prior to the world learning the truth about her upbringing, was that she had emigrated "from... my family lives in Spain they live in Mallorca" to the United States at the age of 19 "to go to NYU."&nbsp;</p><p>But we learned that there were several discrepancies in Hilaria's supposed biography.</p><p>Let's start with the facts: Yes, Hilaria's parents — Dr. Kathryn Hayward and David Thomas — do currently live in Mallorca, but they moved to the island in 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior to that, the American natives lived in Massachusetts, where Kathryn worked as an internist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and David was a businessman and lawyer in Boston "for four decades before he co-founded International Integrators," according to his professional <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bio</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Oh my god.

I spent some of my childhood in Boston, some of my childhood in Spain, my family, my brother, my parents, my nephew, everybody is over there in Spain now, I'm here."</p><p>She also addressed the fact that "I am that person," meaning that "if I've been speaking a lot of Spanish, I tend to mix them or if I'm speaking a lot of English, I mix that, it's one of those things I've always been a bit insecure about."</p><p>"It's not something I'm playing at," she went on to emphasize. "I want that to be very, very clear."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It was not long before her former classmates from the Cambridge School of Weston, located in Cambridge, Mass., came out of the woodwork to back up the claims that Hilaria had previously gone by Hillary, that she had not arrived in the United States for the first time at the age of 19 as she had claimed, and was rather "fully a white girl from Cambridge" who "did not have her current accent."</p><p>"Yes I am a white girl," she went on to say in her next Instagram address. "Europe has a lot of white people in there. My family is white. Ethnically I am a mix of many, many things; culturally, I grew up with the two cultures. So it's really as simple as that."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Now, Hilaria is saying she's multi-cultural and should be allowed to be culturally "fluid."</h2><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> from July 2021, Hilaria continued to defend herself against people who have called her out for faking her Spanish background. In the caption, she says that she had a long conversation with her family about culture and how it can be difficult to feel like you belong when you're a part of a multicultural family.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Hilaria Thomas Baldwin (@hilariabaldwin)</a></p></figure><p>"We need to normalize the fact that we are all unique — our culture, languages, sexual orientations, religions, political beliefs are ALLOWED TO BE FLUID," Hilaria wrote.
