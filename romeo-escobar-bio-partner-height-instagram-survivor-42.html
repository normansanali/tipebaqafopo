It’s only natural that fans are beyond excited to know more about the cast of this season. Today, we bring to you an article about Romeo Escobar, a pageant by profession, and a contestant of Survivor Season 42.</p><p>Read until the end to know about Romeo’s Survivor stint, his partner, job, and more.</p><h3><strong>Romeo Escobar On Survivor 42</strong></h3><p>A little quick overview of the show: Survivor brings a group of strangers together in an isolated location–the Mamanuca Islands off the coast of Fiji for this season–where they must find food and shelter by themselves. In every episode, the cast battle with each other high-intensity challenges, which tests either player’s physical or mental abilities. One contestant is eliminated every episode and the one that survives until the end is given the title of “Sole Survivor” and a handsome cash prize.</p><p>Romeo first announced he was participating in the 42nd season of Survivor on February 10, 2022. He shared a short promotional video on his Instagram and asked his fans and followers to tune into CBS on March 9, 2022, and support him.</p><p>Talking with Parade, Romeo talked about one life experience that he thinks prepared him the most for the game. He revealed that as an immigrant in the US, people don’t expect more from him. He said, “I feel that a lot of times, people don’t expect a lot from people like myself. And so I feel that I’ve been able to overcome all those stereotypes…your past does not dictate your destiny.”</p><p>While Romeo is going strong in the show, one contestant, Zach, is already eliminated. What happened was that the Ika tribe fell behind during the immunity challenge leaving the puzzlers forced to catch up. Zach and Tori were the ones left with the puzzle. All credit to Tori’s social skills, she convinced the rest of the contestants to vote out Zach. The vote against Zach was the first unanimous vote in Survivor’s history.</p><p>In case you did not know, Survivor 42 had an openly trans player, <a href=#>Jackson Fox</a>, as a contestant. Unfortunately, Jackson had to be pulled out of the game for medical reasons. Jackson was on lithium medication and had weaned off the medicine shortly before the show’s production so that it would not be an issue. Contrary to what he thought, the medical tests showed that he was not yet ready to stop taking lithium. Ultimately, Jackson had to leave the show.</p><h3><strong>Romeo Escobar Job</strong></h3><p>As per Romeo Escobar’s bio on CBS, he is a pageant director by profession. He has been working as a National Director–Miss Universe Belize at Miss Universe organization since February 2018.</p><p>Romeo’s LinkedIn profile shows that the Survivor contestant is also a producer at KTLA in Los Angeles, California. Recently, Romeo also started working as a publicist at Miss California USA.</p><p><span style=font-size:17px;letter-spacing:-.01em>His first job, according to his LinkedIn, was as a Segment Producer for Entertainment Tonight. He worked there from July 2007 to September 2015. In the past, Romeo has worked as a Publicist for Kelly K PR, as a Talent Booker at Dundas Media, and as a Senior Talent Booker at Crown Media Family Networks.</span></p><p>Romeo received his education from California State University, Northridge where he studied Television Production from 2003 to 2007.</p><p>Reportedly, the pageant director has also won Emmy Award three times.</p><p>While we don’t know how much Romeo makes as a producer and a pageant director, the average salaries for those jobs in this US are $116 thousand and $98 thousand.</p><h3><strong>Is Romeo Escobar On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Romeo Escobar is on Instagram at <a href=#>@romeoesco</a>. As of this writing, he had 4.4 thousand followers. You can find him on Twitter as well.</p><h3><strong>Romeo Escobar Partner</strong></h3><p>Romeo Escobar’s profile on CBS reveals to us that the pageant director is gay. Talking about Romeo’s personal life, his relationship status was still unclear as of March 2022.</p><p>While Romeo has shared photos with multiple men over the years, it’s difficult to distinguish if those people were only his friend or a partner.</p><p>One time, on October 18, 2015, Romeo shared a picture with a man named Unk Vince and wrote, “Getting ready for last night’s turn up for this guy’s birthday,” in the caption. The other time, on January 13, 2019, Romeo shared a picture with a man and captioned it: ‘Picking up this one from the airport.’</p><p>Recently, KTLA reported that Romeo also struck a bond with another Survivor contestant, Zach, inside the show. Too bad, Zach was eliminated too early from the competition.</p><h3><strong>Romeo Escobar Height</strong></h3><p>Survivor 42 contestant&nbsp; Romeo Escobar stands at an average height of 5 feet 7 inches.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Romeo Escobar?</strong></h3><p>Romeo Escobar was reportedly born in May 1984, which makes him 37 years old in March 2022.</p><h3><strong>Romeo Escobar Family</strong></h3><p>Unfortunately, we don’t know much about Romeo Escobar’s family members.
