Thirty-nine-year-old Aussie Jefferies, who now lives and works in the U.S., comes across like a charismatic drinking buddy with a penchant for popping off at the mouth. Whether he’s telling debauched stories about prostitutes and blow, or knocking the American obsession with guns — as he famously did for 16 minutes in his special, <i>Bare&nbsp;</i>— it’s easy to be charmed by him in spite of his mouth. Jeselnik is something of a dark prince, calmly dispensing depraved one-liners (“Yesterday I accidentally hit a little kid with my car. It wasn’t serious — nobody saw me.”) and following up with a sidelong smirk that dares his audience to protest. A few months after the release of Jefferies’s&nbsp;<i>Freedumb, </i>and nearly one year after Jeselnik’s <i>Thoughts and Prayers </i>premiered&nbsp;<i>—&nbsp;</i>both on Netflix — the two comics talked about reacting to tragedy, responding to hate mail, and how to deal with the ire of frustrated family members.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fa3bd54c2f9985309d6da3b8ef904d41-3-0-0@published data-word-count=46><b>Anthony Jeselnik: Jim, we like and respect each other, but we don’t really know each other.<br></b>Jim Jefferies: We like and respect each other.

How much more do you think I’ve got on it? Do you think I’ve got another 16 minute routine I’m going to churn out?” Each time there’s a massacre or something, I get people writing to me, “Jim, I’m playing your bit again.” But during something like the truck incident in Nice, do you get people going, “Look at my dickhead friend, who’s acting like they’re upset?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fa3bd54c2f9985309d6da3b8ef904d41-8-0-0@published data-word-count=91><b>No, I get, “Where’s your joke for this one?” It’ll be five people who’ll be like, “Where is it?” I used to be like, <i>I need that joke.</i> Now I just ignore it.

How about you?<br></b>Well, my mother, I ripped into her a lot. She has a nickname in one of my early sets called Gunther, after an elephant I saw at the zoo when I was a kid. So it’s gotten to a weird stage with her where she can’t come to gigs anymore because the audience knows exactly who she is: She’s the 300-pound woman with the walking frame and the oxygen tank that people are chanting the elephant’s name to. She can’t really go. I have an uncle I no longer talk to because of a joke I made about my grandmother, who is his mother.

If you want my opinion, here’s my opinion: I don’t want Bill Cosby to rape me.” People are starting to get upset and you make them feel stupid for ever being offended.<br></b>Sadly, the reason I had to write that line was because of the people who started protesting me in Australia. People were writing articles about me that were just, “Jim believes women should enjoy being drugged by men.” I went, <i>I have to tell these people I’m joking. I have to actually say it. </i>I felt like I had to do it. And then, as I did it, I went, <i>Oh okay, now no one can complain about the joke.</i> Hopefully they did feel stupid.

I was sitting three rows behind and I’m like, “That’s the six-foot-eight ginger guy who’s blocking my view.” I was with my girlfriend, and my baby was three months old and strapped to my chest in a baby carrier. I said to my girlfriend, “I know Conan, I’ve done his show twice. I’ll go talk to Conan and I’ll get to meet Jack White.” This is all working out fine. And I walked up with my baby strapped to my chest and said, “Hey!” And then Conan turned his head, and he looked at me with no recognition whatsoever, and I chickened out.
