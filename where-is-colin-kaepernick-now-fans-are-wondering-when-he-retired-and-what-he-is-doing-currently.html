Similarly, he is the face of Ergatta, the maker of the world’s first connected rowing machine powered by game-based content.</p><p>Ergatta, which claims to “disrupt at-home training,” believes Kaepernick brings fitness knowledge to their platform. Since 2020, Kaepernick has served as an advisor to the firm.</p><p>Colin and his partner Nessa Diab founded the Know Your Rights Camp in 2016 to draw attention to the reasons for his national anthem protest.</p><p>Likewise, Colin appears to have relocated to New York. He declared in 2020 that he will publish a memoir through a publishing business he formed.</p><p>He is currently a free agent, states that he still wants to play football and is working toward that goal.</p><p>Also Read :&nbsp;Where Are Madeleine Albright Children Katherine Medill And Anne Korbel Now?
